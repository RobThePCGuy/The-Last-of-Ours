# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 3: The Ambush

A sharp pain in her wrists pulled Abby from the void. Her eyes snapped open. For a moment she didn't know where she was or what had happened. The smell of smoke and blood brought it rushing back like a tidal wave. She was on her knees in the courtyard, hands bound tightly behind her to a metal post. Her head throbbed where she'd been struck, and when she tried to move, a fiery ache radiated from her bruised ribs and thigh. Night still blanketed the sky, but it was filled with flickering orange light from fires that still burned around the camp.

There were bodies on the ground, some wearing the Firefly symbol, others in the attackers' dark gear. Abby's stomach lurched at the sheer number of people motionless in pools of blood. How long was I out? she wondered hazily. It couldn't have been more than minutes.

Voices cut through the ringing in her ears.

", round up the rest. Check the buildings," barked a man to her left. Abby turned her head and saw a stout, bearded figure giving orders. He wore the same Kevlar with the white C emblem. A leader, by the way others obeyed him without question. "We need to move before more of them return."

Nearby, two of his soldiers dragged Dr. Angela out of the clinic, her legs struggling weakly. Angela's eyes were wide with terror above a gag. The soldiers shoved her to her knees and restrained her.

Abby's blood boiled. She flexed her arms against the zip-ties cutting into her wrists, testing for any give. None.

A third soldier emerged from a collapsed hut hauling Rowan with a pistol to his head. Rowan's face was bloodied, but he was alive.

The leader, Beard, Abby named him silently, strode closer and surveyed the hostages: Abby, Rowan, Dr. Angela, and a couple of terrified young recruits held at gunpoint by the remaining attackers. Beard's jaw clenched as he looked at the bodies scattered around. His eyes landed on the corpse of the man Abby had strangled. His face twisted with grief and rage.

"Eli... damn you," Beard hissed under his breath. He marched up to Abby and backhanded her viciously across the face. Abby grunted, seeing stars again.

"You," he growled, grabbing a fistful of Abby's hair and forcing her to meet his eyes. His face was inches from hers, teeth bared. "You killed my little brother. Do you know that?" Spittle hit her cheek. "He came here to clean out a nest of murderers, and you killed him."

Little brother, Abby realized in a detached way that he meant the man she strangled, or maybe someone else tonight. Her thoughts were sluggish, still fogged by the blow to her head. "You invaded us," she rasped, tasting blood from her split lip. "Who... who are you people?"

He yanked her hair harder. "We are the Commonwealth," he snarled. "We're the ones who will bring order back to this country, starting by stamping out terrorist trash like you."

Commonwealth? Abby's mind raced. She had heard distant chatter on the radio about a rising faction out of California calling themselves that, a group bent on taking power wherever FEDRA and others had left a vacuum. She hadn't known they'd taken interest in the Fireflies. Terrorists, he said, like the old FEDRA propaganda. They thought the Fireflies were terrorists restarting a war.

Beard's gaze flicked to Abby's chest, where a faded Firefly pendant hung around her neck, a keepsake of her father's, now an open declaration of loyalty. "Fireflies had their chance at this world, and they failed," he spat. "We're not about to let you come back."

A soldier jogged up and saluted the leader. "Sir, we found a boat hidden on the west cove. Loaded with supplies and letters... looks like they were communicating with people on the mainland. Orders, rendezvous points."

Beard sneered at Abby. "Trying to rebuild your little rebellion everywhere, huh? Not on my watch." He released her hair, letting her head slump. Abby's heart pounded as she grasped what this was, they hadn't attacked for resources or out of random malice. They aimed to exterminate the Fireflies before they could regain strength. And she had led them right to a significant group of them, collected in one place.

The leader paced, fury rolling off him in waves. "Gather anything useful from their comms center. Burn the rest. And sink that boat."

As his soldiers moved to obey, Abby's eyes desperately scanned the courtyard for any sign of Lev. Please, she begged silently, if there's a godâ€¦

Her gaze fell on a small, still form lying near the steps of the clinic. There, half in shadow, was Lev. He lay on his back where he fell, bow still clutched loosely in one hand. A dark stain spread across his shirt where the bullet hit. He wasn't moving.

All air rushed from Abby's lungs. She strained forward with a choked sound. "Lev!" she screamed, voice cracking. "LEV!"

Beard barely spared a glance. "He's dead. You will be too, soon enough." He motioned to one of the men. "We got what we needed from the doctor and the radio guy. As for the rest, " he looked at Abby with cold hatred, "finish them off."

The soldier nodded and cocked his rifle, stepping toward Abby first. Time slowed again, but this time with crystal clarity. Abby felt a cold calm wash over her, a singular focus sharpening her thoughts. She saw Lev's lifeless shape just a few yards away. She saw Dr. Angela close her eyes in resignation, Rowan trembling, the recruits quietly weeping. And she saw the Commonwealth soldier raise his gun toward her head.

Not like this.

With a feral roar, Abby heaved upward with everything she had, the zip-tie biting into her flesh until it snapped. In one fluid motion she grabbed the surprised soldier's rifle barrel and shoved it aside as it discharged, the shot whizzing past her ear. Using the post she was tied to for leverage, Abby yanked the man forward and drove her knee into his groin. He crumpled with a howl.

"Shoot her!" Beard barked, reaching for his own sidearm. But Abby was already moving. She dove for the downed soldier's dropped rifle. A hail of bullets tore into the dirt where she'd been kneeling a split second before.

Abby rolled and came up firing. Her first burst caught the soldier who'd been holding Rowan, hitting him square in the chest. He fell, and Rowan scrambled away on hands and knees. The next shots she directed at another attacker rushing from her right, dropping him as well. Years of drilling, of battle instinct, took over; the pain in her body was forgotten, adrenaline fueling her aim.

Beard ducked behind a concrete pillar as Abby's next bullets sparked off it. Dr. Angela and the recruits had thrown themselves flat in the confusion. The only enemy left was Beard himself, now pinned down by Abby's gunfire. She advanced, teeth gritted, feeling every ounce of righteous wrath pumping in her veins. This man had ordered her people killed, had killed Lev. Abby's vision went red.

She kept firing until the rifle clicked empty. The pillar was chipped and pocked, but Beard still hid behind it. Breathing hard, Abby tossed aside the spent gun and limped toward the center of the courtyard. Smoke burned her eyes. Flames crackled from a structure about to collapse. The night air reeked of blood and ash.

"Come out!" Abby roared into the silence. "Face me!" She scanned for movement. The only sound was the crackle of embers and Dr. Angela's muffled sobs in the background.

A clatter drew Abby's attention, Beard's rifle skidding out from behind the pillar. He emerged right after, arms raised halfway. She saw he had a knife in one hand, glinting orange in the firelight.

His face contorted with rage and despair. "You... you'll pay for what you did," he spat. "My brother, my men... all dead because of you."

Abby's lip curled. "You attacked us, asshole." She advanced a step, fists clenched. Her leg throbbed where she'd been shot, but she barely registered it.

The leader's eyes flickered past her, toward Lev's body. "Your people murdered and enslaved in Santa Barbara. You think we wouldn't seek justice? You think I wouldn't hunt down the woman responsible?" His glare bore into Abby. "Yes, I know what you did. One of your victims escaped to tell the tale."

Abby realized he was talking about the Rattlers, the slavers who had captured her and Lev in Santa Barbara. She had indeed slaughtered many of them during their escape, liberating captives. She felt no remorse for that. Those men were monsters. But apparently one had survived and joined this Commonwealth, spinning a story that painted Abby as the villain.

"We freed their prisoners," Abby snarled. "Those bastards were slavers. They deserved worse." She spat a glob of blood at the ground. "If that's who you're avenging, then you're as bad as they were."

Beard's expression faltered just a moment, uncertainty in his eyes. Then fury overtook him. With a hoarse yell, he lunged at Abby, swinging the knife.

Abby was ready. She sidestepped his slash, catching his wrist with both hands. He was strong and barrel-chested, but Abby fueled her movements with raw anguish. She slammed his arm against the pillar; bones cracked and the knife clattered free. Beard roared in pain and punched at her with his off-hand, grazing her cheek. Abby barely flinched. She grabbed the front of his vest and drove him backward, slamming him down onto the concrete rubble.

He hit the ground with a pained oof. In a flash, Abby picked up a brick from the shattered pillar. She loomed over the man who had ordered Lev's death, who had tried to wipe out all the Fireflies in cold blood. Her vision blurred with tears of rage as she raised the brick.

"Wait, !" Beard rasped, throwing a hand up in a feeble warding gesture. His eyes widened at the murderous resolve on Abby's face. In that moment, he was simply afraid to die.

So had her friends been. So had Lev.

Abby brought the brick down. Once, twice, three times, until the man's face was unrecognizable and her own arms trembled from the force of her vengeance. When she finally stopped, panting, a dark red mist seemed to cloud the air. Beard lay still, his skull caved in, blood pooling around his head.

Silence fell at last over Catalina Island. Abby staggered to her feet, the brick slipping from her fingers. Immediately her knees buckled as the rush of adrenaline ebbed, pain flooding in. She clutched the bullet graze on her thigh, wet blood coated her palm. Her ribs and head throbbed fiercely.

But none of it compared to the pain in her heart.

"Levâ€¦" she croaked, forcing herself up and limping to where Lev lay. She dropped to her knees beside him. The boy's eyes were half-open, staring at the starless smoky sky. Abby's hands shook as she reached out to touch his face. It was still warm. For one stupid, hopeful second she thought maybe he was just unconscious. But his chest was still, no breath, and the wound... The bullet had gone straight through. Too much blood.

"No, no, no," Abby whispered, gathering Lev's limp body into her arms. His head lolled against her shoulder as she cradled him. He felt so light, as if all the life that gave him weight had fled. "Lev... pleaseâ€¦" She rocked him gently, tears sliding down her grime-streaked cheeks. "I'm here, I'm here. Wake up, kiddo... Pleaseâ€¦" Her voice broke.

He did not stir. The kid who had become her family, the one who saved her soul, was gone. Abby pressed her forehead to Lev's and let out a keening sob. Grief, stark and all-consuming, crashed over her. She had failed him. Just like she had failed Yara. Just like she had failed her father. Everyone she ever tried to protect... gone.

Dr. Angela and the others slowly approached, having freed themselves once it was safe. But they kept a respectful distance, forming a silent, mourning circle around Abby and the boy she held.

Minutes or hours later, Abby couldn't tell, a subtle noise pricked at the edge of her awareness. Footsteps, approaching cautiously over debris. Abby's grief sharpened into protectiveness in an instant. She gently laid Lev down and rose, picking up the fallen knife from earlier. Someone was coming, maybe another enemy? Her muscles protested as she staggered upright, but she gripped the blade, ready to fight until she couldn't breathe.

A lone figure emerged from behind the charred husk of the radio tower. The stranger's silhouette was slight and carrying a backpack. They froze upon seeing the massacre in the courtyard.

In the flicker of firelight, Abby saw a young woman with auburn hair, her face dirty and wary. Recognition slammed into Abby as the woman stepped forward, green eyes wide at the sight of Abby dripping in blood and standing amid corpses.

Ellie.

Abby's world tilted. She thought for a moment she was hallucinating from pain and sorrow. Ellie was the last person she expected to see here, now. Those eyes, the last time Abby had seen them, they were filled with vengeful fury on a beach in Santa Barbara, before Ellie had decided to spare her life. Now they stared with shock, confusion... maybe even concern?

Ellie's gaze darted from Abby's battered form to Lev's lifeless body on the ground, and the cluster of traumatized Fireflies nearby. Her lips parted as if to speak, but she hesitated, caught between approach and retreat.

Abby's grief ignited into sudden rage. In her daze, her mind leapt to a horrific assumption: Ellie had come here, found them, and maybe... had something to do with this? The idea made no logical sense, but Abby wasn't thinking clearly. Pain and vengeance were all she knew in that moment. With a guttural yell, Abby charged at Ellie, knife raised.

Ellie barely had time to register the movement. Abby tackled her to the ground, knocking Ellie's backpack aside. The knife arced down, but Ellie managed to twist, the blade skittering off the armored plate of her jacket shoulder instead of flesh. "Abby, wait!" Ellie gasped, raising her forearms to ward off Abby's frenzied strikes. Abby swung again, a wild slash that nicked Ellie's cheek.

"YOU, " Abby snarled, voice ragged. She pinned Ellie with her weight. Ellie, smaller but wiry, fought back defensively, grabbing Abby's wrist to stop the knife plunging toward her throat. "What did you DO?!" Abby's face was a mask of grief and fury above Ellie.

"I, I didn't, !" Ellie gritted her teeth, straining against Abby's strength. Even injured and exhausted, Abby was formidable. Ellie knew Abby could end her right here, but strangely, she felt no desire to hurt Abby. Not anymore. In a scramble, Ellie managed to get a leg free and kicked upward, forcing Abby off balance.

The two women separated, rolling to their feet in unison. They faced each other amidst the carnage, chests heaving. Abby's knife glinted in one hand; Ellie's own switchblade had found its way into her palm. An eerie mirror of their final confrontation years ago in that Seattle theater, except now both were battered, hearts heavy with recent wounds.

Abby's eyes were wild, tears still streaming down her face. "You brought them here, didn't you?" she growled, voice breaking. "You couldn't let it go... you came to finish it!"

Ellie shook her head, panting. A thin line of blood trickled from the cut on her cheek. "Abby, no! I swear, I had nothing to do with this!" She flicked a desperate glance around at the bodies. "I-I heard the explosions and came running. I didn't know... I was coming to find the Fireflies!"

Abby's grip on the knife wavered. Confusion knitted her brow, cutting through her haze. "Why would youâ€¦?" Her eyes darted to Lev's body, and fresh agony twisted her features. She took a step toward Ellie, knife still raised uncertainly. "My friends are dead. He's dead," she choked out, voice raw. "Why shouldn't I blame you?"

Ellie swallowed, holding her ground but not attacking. She could see Abby's devastation and knew too well the madness grief could drive someone to. Her own rage had made her a monster once; she recognized it now in Abby. "Because it's not my fault," she said, trying to keep her voice calm but loud enough to penetrate Abby's anguish. "That group, whoever they are, I'm not with them. I was looking for this place to, " She faltered. How much did Abby know? Likely nothing. ", to find purpose," she finished vaguely. "I only got here as it was happening."

A strained silence stretched. The firelight flickered over Abby's torn expression. Behind them, Dr. Angela quietly ushered the others out of harm's way, into the shadows.

Abby's shoulders heaved. The knife in her hand trembled. She stared at Ellie as if seeing her for the first time, a lone figure who looked almost as broken as Abby felt. Ellie's hands were open at her sides now, her blade lowered. She wasn't attacking.

Ellie took a slow breath. "Abby... I'm sorry," she said softly, and her eyes flicked to Lev's body. Sincere sorrow tinged her voice. She had barely known the boy, but she remembered his kindness on that theater stage, saving Dina's life by stopping Abby. And now he lay still. "I'm so sorry."

Abby's face crumpled. All the fight drained out of her in an instant. Her knife slipped from her fingers and clattered to the ground. A ragged sob tore from her throat and she sank to her knees. The pain was overwhelming, physical and emotional. She pressed her palms to her face as if trying to hold herself together, but she was shattering.

Ellie stood there, heart pounding, as Abby collapsed into grief. Carefully, she knelt a short distance in front of Abby, making sure to move slowly. She still didn't fully trust Abby's volatile state, but some instinct told her the danger had passed.

Abby's sobs were gut-wrenching. "They're dead... everyone's dead," she gasped between breaths, fingers digging into her scalp. "Lev... I couldn't save him. I couldn't, " She broke off, shaking.

Ellie's chest tightened. Despite everything, despite the history of blood and loss between them, seeing Abby like this stirred a deep empathy in her. Abby had once been her mortal enemy, but right now she was just a person who'd lost someone she loved. Ellie knew too well what that pain felt like.

Without quite realizing she was doing it, Ellie inched closer and placed a hand gently on Abby's shoulder. Abby flinched at the touch and looked up, eyes red and wet. There was shock in her expression that Ellie was still here, that Ellie wasn't trying to hurt her.

"I'm sorry," Ellie repeated, earnest and gentle. "That boy... he meant a lot to you."

Abby wiped her nose with the back of her hand, nodding mutely. Fresh tears spilled. "He was... he was everything. My family." She drew a shuddering breath. "I promised to protect him."

Ellie's throat burned. She thought of Sam and Henry, of Tess, of Joel, so many promises to keep each other safe, broken by this vicious world. "Sometimes... no matter how hard we try... we can't," she said quietly, voice thick with her own old grief.

Abby closed her eyes, tears leaking out. For a long moment, they just stayed like that: Abby on her knees amid ruins, and Ellie kneeling nearby, a hesitant hand on her shoulder as the fires around them guttered low.

At last, Abby's sobs subsided into uneven sniffles. She opened her eyes and looked at Ellie in bewilderment, as if truly registering her presence now. "Why are you here, Ellie?" Her tone held no anger now, only exhaustion and confusion. "After everything... why would you come find us?"

Ellie withdrew her hand and sat back on her heels, giving Abby a bit of space. She wasn't sure how to begin. The truth seemed impossible, but maybe it was time it came out. Her gaze drifted to the bloody Firefly pendant hanging from Abby's neck, then to the corpses around them, then finally to Lev's still face. She owed him, perhaps, this honesty, for he had a part in stopping the cycle of hate between her and Abby once.

"I heard the Fireflies were regrouping," Ellie said slowly. "Looking for someone... someone immune." She hesitated, watching Abby's face for recognition. Abby frowned, listening intently. "I thought... maybe I could help. That maybe it was finally time to stop running from... from who I am."

Abby's eyes narrowed slightly. "Someone immune? You mean... the rumor is real?"

Ellie's heart pounded. This was it. She reached up and tugged the bandage she kept wrapped around her forearm, pulling it down to reveal the grotesque scar of her bite. In the low light, it was just visible, faintly luminescent fungus-like patterns etched into her skin. The mark of a decades-old infection that never spread.

Abby stared at the scar, not comprehending at first. Then her eyes widened. She knew a bite scar when she saw one. "That's... impossible," she breathed.

Ellie managed a shaky half-smile that held no joy. "Not impossible. Not for me. I was bitten when I was fourteen. I should've turned, but I didn't. I never have."

Abby shook her head slowly, denial and astonishment warring on her face. Ellie couldn't blame her, if she hadn't lived it, she wouldn't believe it either. To prove her point, Ellie slid aside the collar of her shirt and exposed another scar at her shoulder, a much more recent bite, courtesy of a Rattler that attacked her during her trip to Santa Barbara. It too had healed without turning her.

"They bit me here, a couple years ago," Ellie said softly. "Nothing happened, just like before."

Abby's lips parted. Ellie could practically see the pieces falling into place in Abby's mind, the realization dawning of what this could mean. Abby's father... the Firefly lab... Joel... Her eyes flicked to Ellie's face, searching it, as if to confirm this wasn't some sick prank. "You're immune," she whispered, the word laden with awe.

Ellie nodded, her stomach twisting. "I am."

Abby rocked back as if hit by a wave. She looked around at the devastation, then back at Ellie. "And... and you came here... to what? Sacrifice yourself?"

Ellie lowered her gaze. "If that's what it takes," she admitted softly. "I should have done it years ago." Her voice hardened a little with old guilt. "I was supposed to. The Fireflies had me in that hospital in Salt Lake... they were going to make a cure from me."

Abby sucked in a sharp breath. Her hands went slack in her lap. "Salt Lake... hospitalâ€¦" she echoed. Her face paled as truth crashed over her. "My dad... my dad was there."

Ellie nodded, throat tight. "Jerry Anderson. He was the surgeon. The one who... who was going to operate on me." She blinked back the sting in her eyes. "He was your father, wasn't he?"

Abby's mouth opened, but no sound came out. She looked as though the ground had dropped beneath her. At long last, she gave a tiny nod. "How... how do you know his name?"

A sad smile tugged at Ellie's lips. "Because Joel told me. I made him tell me everything." She took a shaky breath. This was the hardest part. "That day, when you found him... when you killed Joel... He was there in that hospital to save me. To save everyone. And Joel... Joel stopped it. He stopped the surgery and took me away. He killed your dad to protect me."

Abby flinched as if struck. A strangled noise escaped her, and she pressed a hand over her mouth. Ellie could see the storm of emotions raging behind her eyes: anger, disbelief, guilt, sadness, all swirling together.

"I-I didn't know," Abby stammered finally, voice trembling. "I knew he was killed protecting someone, but... I didn't know it was you. I didn't know what you were." A tear slipped down her cheek. "All this time... Joel took that from the world... I... I took Joel from the world... and none of us knew."

Ellie felt her own tears welling. It was agonizing to see Abby realize the full weight of what her revenge had cost. "Joel did what he did out of love," she said. "And you... you did what you did out of love too, I guess. Love for your dad." She managed to meet Abby's gaze. "This world... it's always making us choose between the people we care about and the future everyone might have. Joel chose me. You chose your revenge." She looked at Lev's body. "And tonight, you chose him."

Abby followed Ellie's eyes to Lev. She inhaled a shaky breath and nodded. "I did." A silence lingered, the two women united in grief and understanding.

Ellie gingerly rose to her feet, bruises and exhaustion making her ache. She extended a hand toward Abby. "Come on," she said softly. "We... we should tend to the others. Then we can figure out our next steps."

Abby glanced up at Ellie's outstretched hand, the same hand that had once held a knife to her throat in Seattle. Now it was offering help. Abby hesitated only a moment before taking it. Ellie pulled her to her feet. Abby swayed, her injuries catching up to her, and Ellie grabbed her elbow to steady her.

Dr. Angela and Rowan approached tentatively, relief evident that the fight was over. Rowan had a rifle slung over his shoulder, likely taken from one of the fallen attackers. He looked at Abby and Ellie with equal parts confusion and hope, not yet knowing what had passed between them in those moments of revelation.

Abby cleared her throat, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. She straightened, regaining a bit of composure in front of her people. "Is... is anyone else alive?" she asked, her voice rough but authoritative.

Rowan shook his head grimly. "Only us here, and a few who ran into the woods. We'll try to signal them when it's safe. The boat... it's gone. They sank it."

Abby nodded, jaw clenching at that blow. It meant they were stranded for now. "We'll think of something," she said, trying to sound confident. She looked to Dr. Angela. "Are you hurt?"

The older woman shook her head, though her eyes were puffy from crying. "Just shaken." Her gaze fell to Ellie curiously, noting the way Abby stood close by her side rather than at her throat. "Whoâ€¦?"

"This is Ellie," Abby introduced quietly. She glanced at Ellie, a new weight behind her eyes. "She's... the one we've been looking for. The immune girl."

The realization rippled through the small group. Rowan's eyes widened and Dr. Angela's hand flew to her mouth in astonishment. One of the young recruits, a teenage boy who had survived by hiding under a corpse during the fight, murmured, "No wayâ€¦"

Ellie felt self-conscious under the sudden awed stares. She rubbed her scarred forearm, covering it again with her sleeve. "I'm not much to look at," she joked weakly. "But yeah. It's true."

Abby placed a steadying hand on Ellie's shoulder, an almost protective gesture that surprised them both. "We should... take stock and treat wounds," she said. Her tone had shifted to brisk determination, a leader's voice tempered by sorrow. "Then plan. We can't stay here long; they might come back with more."

Dr. Angela nodded and immediately moved toward the infirmary, motioning for Ellie and Abby to follow so she could tend to their injuries. Rowan began gathering whatever weapons and supplies he could salvage from the fallen.

Abby paused and looked down at Lev one more time. Her eyes shone with tears not yet shed. "We'll take him with us," Ellie said gently, reading her thoughts. "We'll give him a proper... a proper goodbye when we can."

Abby swallowed hard and whispered, "Thank you." It was unclear whether she meant for that or for something far greater. Perhaps both.

Together, Abby and Ellie carefully lifted Lev's body, carrying him toward the remnants of the clinic where they could wrap him. In that moment, their past enmity felt distant, swallowed by the enormity of what they had lost and what they had discovered. Their shared goal, once unimaginable, now bound them: they would see that Lev's death, that all this death, was not in vain. They would seek out the cure, together.

In the shattered remnants of the Firefly camp, under the smoke-streaked sky, an uneasy alliance was born. Two survivors, once enemies, now walked side by side into an uncertain dawn, carrying the weight of the world's last hope between them.
