# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 2: Fireflies Reborn

The sound of waves gently lapping against the docks usually soothed Abby's nerves. On Catalina Island, every evening carried the tang of salt air and a brief, peaceful hush at dusk. Abby Anderson stood at the end of an old pier turned lookout post, scanning the darkening horizon. Far across the water, the coast was a hazy line. Somewhere over there lay Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and countless ruins of the old world. Two years ago, Abby had crossed that water in search of a new beginning. Against all odds, she had found one.

Behind her, the settlement that the Fireflies had built on Catalina glowed with lantern light. Dozens of survivors milled about inside the repurposed resort complex, once a tourist getaway, now a fortified base. These were the new Fireflies: former soldiers, idealistic runaways, surviving Firefly veterans from a decade ago who answered the call when rumors spread of a regrouping. Abby had not expected to become a leader among them, but her determination and combat experience quickly made her essential. She taught them how to fight, how to defend their home, and most importantly, she shared the dream her father had died for: finding a cure.

A familiar voice called out from the shore. "Hey, Abs! You coming? Food's getting cold!"

Abby turned to see Lev waving to her from the beach, a playful grin on his now less-boyish face. At sixteen, Lev's lean frame had grown taller, and the last traces of childhood roundness were gone from his features. In the orange glow of the sunset, the scar of his former Seraphite life, a faint mark where his head had been shaved, was nearly invisible beneath the short crop of hair he now kept. He wore a patched Firefly jacket several sizes too big, and in his hands he held two tin bowls.

"Alright, I'm coming!" Abby shouted back, a small smile tugging at her lips. She took one last gaze toward the mainland. It was quiet tonight; nothing but gently bobbing waves and distant gulls. Satisfied, she slung her rifle over her shoulder and headed down the pier to join Lev.

They walked together up the beach toward the heart of the camp. As they passed the old stucco buildings of the resort, Abby nodded to a pair of sentries on patrol. They saluted her respectfully, an acknowledgment she still wasn't entirely comfortable with. Two years ago, Abby had been a soldier in the Washington Liberation Front, leading missions in Seattle's war. Now she led a very different kind of fight.

In the open courtyard that served as a mess hall, Lev handed Abby one of the bowls. It was stew again, canned beef mixed with island-grown vegetables. Abby's stomach growled at the savory scent. The two of them sat on a low wall under a string of lights powered by a jury-rigged generator. Around them, other Fireflies chatted and ate under the early night sky.

Lev dug into his portion eagerly. Between bites he said, "Anna was asking if I could join the scout team heading to the north end of the island tomorrow. They're checking out that grounded ferry for medical supplies."

"Think you're ready to play medic on your own?" Abby teased lightly. Lev had taken to training as a field medic and scout, roles that fit his nimble build and keen eyes. She spooned some stew and added, "Just be careful. I hear that ferry's crawling with infected."

Lev rolled his eyes dramatically. "I will. Besides, we cleared most of them last week." He grew more serious for a moment. "If I find any surgical supplies... it could help Dr. Angela, right? In case we ever... you know, find them."

Abby set her bowl down. She knew what he meant. If they ever found someone immune, the person who could turn everything around. "If we find them," she echoed with measured hope. "Dr. Angela will definitely need every tool she can get." Abby's chest tightened briefly. The idea of a cure was both a guiding star and a painful reminder. Her father had died believing in that cause, scalpel in hand, about to operate on some immune girl. Abby had never even known the patient's name; after the Fireflies fell apart, she only learned that a smuggler had killed all the doctors and fled with the girl. For years Abby's heart had burned with vengeance for her father's death. She got her revenge, Joel Miller paid in blood. But that vengeance hadn't brought her father back, nor the world any closer to a cure. It was Lev who finally gave Abby's life new purpose, and through him, she found her way back to her father's dream.

Lev nudged her gently with his elbow, sensing her darkening mood. "Hey. We'll find someone, Abby. We have leads. You said it yourself, patience, right?"

Abby looked at the teenager who had become like a brother to her. He always had a way of cutting through her gloom. She mustered a small smile. "Right. Patience."

Truthfully, Abby had begun to wonder if immunity was a myth. They'd heard only fragments: old stories out of Jackson of a girl who survived bites (but Jackson's folk were tight-lipped), or whispers from travelers of some immune out east that vanished. Nothing concrete. And Abby certainly never imagined the enemy she'd fought in Seattle could have been that very girl. Ellie's name was never attached to those rumors in Abby's presence, Ellie had remained a stranger with a grudge, not a possible savior.

Lev finished his stew and stretched. "I'll be careful tomorrow. And tonight I'll pack extra bandages, just in case."

Abby bumped her shoulder against his. "That's my medic."

They sat in comfortable silence for a time, watching the last light drain from the sky. Abby found herself actually laughing when Lev recounted how he'd outsmarted Manny in a target practice contest that morning. Laughter felt foreign on her tongue, but good. The nightmares of Seattle and Santa Barbara had dulled with time. She still woke some nights thinking of Yara's last moments, or hearing Tommy's sniper shot, or seeing Joel's face under her golf club. But those nights were becoming rarer. In their place, new memories were forming: Lev learning to fish off the pier; the cheers when their radio picked up a distant Firefly cell in New Mexico; the simple solace of not being hated or feared by those around her.

When they finished eating, Abby ruffled Lev's hair affectionately (earning a squawk of protest about messing it up) and took the empty bowls back to the cookfire. The head cook, an older man named Luis, smiled at her. "Another day down," he remarked.

"Another day," Abby agreed. A day where she hadn't had to kill anyone or watch someone die, a low bar, but one she was grateful to clear more often now.

Lev wandered off to chat with a pair of scouts, and Abby decided to turn in for the night. She needed rest; tomorrow brought another round of planning and radio calls. As she headed toward the building where her quarters were, she heard Dr. Angela's voice through an open doorway.

"…blood tests came back inconclusive. It could be just a mutation in the sample, but, "

"Keep testing," came another voice, their communications chief, Rowan. "If it's a false lead, it's a false lead. But if not…"

Abby slowed her step. She shouldn't eavesdrop, but the topic was too enticing. They were discussing an immune candidate, she realized. Likely some sample sent by a contact. Her heart quickened. Could it be real this time?

Before she could listen further, Lev jogged up behind her. "Abby, you left your flashlight," he said, holding out the small device. "You'll need it. Power's still spotty in the dorms."

Abby blinked, shaken from her thoughts. "Oh, thanks." She took the flashlight, giving one last glance toward the door where Dr. Angela was talking. Not tonight, she told herself. If it were big news, they would inform her. Patience.

She and Lev headed inside their building. It was one of the smaller former hotel structures, with sand still strewn across the tiled lobby floor. At the stairwell, Lev bounded up two steps at a time. Abby followed at a slower pace, rolling her stiff shoulder. Though still strong, her muscles ached more nowadays. She wasn't twenty anymore, and the years of hard living left their marks. She had maintained some of her old training routine, but leadership duties often kept her off the exercise field. Her arms had lost some of the bulk from her WLF days, though she remained powerful by anyone's standards.

On the second floor, Abby entered her room, simple but comfortable. Lev's room was just across the hall. "Goodnight, Abby," he called, ducking into his bunk. "Don't stay up late reading those old science journals again."

Abby chuckled. "No promises. Night, Lev." She shut her door and leaned against it for a moment, a long exhale escaping her. These quiet moments, alone with her thoughts, were sometimes the hardest. She rubbed the beaded bracelet on her wrist, Alice's name etched into one of the beads, in memory of her lost dog, and then reached under her cot. From a hidden box, she pulled out a photograph, its edges worn soft. It showed a much younger Abby hugging a tall man with kind eyes and a gentle smile. Her father. One of the other doctors had snapped the picture at the hospital just weeks before that fateful day. She allowed herself a few seconds to look at his face.

"We're close, Dad," she whispered. "I can feel it. We'll find them." She carefully returned the photo to its box and lay down on the cot.

The night was warm and still. Abby drifted into a light sleep, the murmurs of camp life quieting one by one. She dreamed she was back in that Salt Lake City hospital, wandering the empty halls. She was calling for her father, but only her echo answered. Somewhere in the distance, she heard the faint strum of a guitar and a young girl's voice humming a song, an eerie melody that made her heart pound with inexplicable sorrow.

A thunderous boom jolted Abby awake. The walls shook. For a split second, she thought she was still dreaming, memories of explosions during the WLF-Seraphite war bleeding into the present. But as a second blast resounded, Abby leapt off the cot, adrenaline surging.

Shouts erupted outside. Abby snatched her rifle and flung open the door. Across the hall, Lev stumbled out of his room, eyes wide and alarmed. "What's happening?!" he yelled over the din.

"I don't know," Abby shouted back. "Stay close!"

They rushed down the stairs two at a time. Through a window, Abby caught sight of muzzle flashes and silhouettes moving in the courtyard. Gunfire rattled through the night. An alarm bell clanged, a shrill, desperate sound.

Abby's heart tightened. The camp was under attack.

By the time they reached the ground floor, people were scrambling everywhere. A scout burst into the lobby, bleeding from a wound in her side. "We're under attack, an armed group from the mainland!" she gasped. "They have the docks surrounded."

Abby nodded sharply, forcing herself into a soldier's clarity. "Get to cover and put pressure on that wound. Lev, take her to the clinic."

Lev's face was taut with fear, but he nodded and slid under the scout's arm, helping her toward the back rooms where Dr. Angela had her infirmary.

Abby sprinted toward the front entrance. As she emerged into the courtyard, chaos greeted her. Several buildings were on fire, throwing flickering light and shadows across the scene. She saw her fellow Fireflies scattered, exchanging gunfire with figures in dark armor who advanced with military precision. The attackers moved in coordinated formation, forcing the Fireflies to retreat toward the center of camp. They were well-armed, Abby glimpsed assault rifles, shotguns, even a flamethrower carried by a hulking man setting cabins ablaze.

Abby ducked behind a concrete planter just as bullets sprayed her way. She popped up to return fire, managing to hit one attacker who had flanked left. He crumpled with a cry. Another explosion rocked the night, likely a grenade. The attackers were closing in relentlessly.

"Fall back to the rec center!" Abby shouted, hoping her voice would rally some defense. That building was sturdier; they could bottleneck the enemy. She saw Rowan, the communications chief, dragging a wounded comrade toward cover. Not far, Dr. Angela crouched behind an overturned table, holding a pistol with trembling hands.

Abby fired again, dropping a second invader who tried to rush the clinic door. For an instant, she locked eyes with the man behind him, a tall figure wearing a Kevlar vest emblazoned with a strange insignia: a painted white C crossed with a lightning bolt. He snarled something at her she couldn't hear over the commotion.

Suddenly, from the corner of her eye, Abby saw Lev reappear at the infirmary doorway. "Lev, no!" she screamed, but her voice drowned in the thunder of gunfire.

Lev had his bow in hand and released an arrow that found the neck of an assailant about to torch the clinic. The man fell, dropping the Molotov that whooshed harmlessly on the ground. Lev looked to Abby for just a moment, checking she was alright. That moment was his mistake.

The tall man with the white C insignia turned his rifle toward Lev. Abby saw the muzzle flare, 

BANG! The shot echoed.

Lev jerked as the bullet struck him in the chest. Time seemed to slow. Abby's scream tore from her throat, raw and wordless, as Lev crumpled to the ground.

"No! LEV!" Abby barreled out from behind the planter, firing wildly at the man who'd shot Lev. Her vision blurred with fury and panic. She felt a searing pain crease her thigh, she'd been hit, but she didn't care. The shooter tried to back away as she charged, but Abby slammed into him with the force of a freight train. They both hit the dirt.

In a frenzy, Abby smashed the butt of her rifle into the man's face once, twice, his nose crunched and he yelled, grappling with her. He was strong, but adrenaline made Abby stronger. She rolled on top of him, hands closing around his throat. Her fingers dug into his flesh. "You son of a, " she snarled, squeezing with all her might. The man thrashed, choking. His fist pounded feebly against her side, but Abby didn't relent. At the edges of her vision she could see more of the attackers swarming the courtyard, and the shapes of Fireflies either fleeing or dying. But nothing existed except the man beneath her, the one who shot Lev.

With a final, brutal twist, she heard his neck snap. Abby flung his limp body aside, gasping for breath.

Before she could gather herself, a heavy blow struck the back of her head. Stars exploded in her eyes and she pitched forward. The world spun. Someone must have snuck up behind her... She tried to push up from the ground, but another impact, a boot connecting with her ribs, sent her collapsing onto her side. Pain shot through her torso, and she tasted coppery blood on her tongue.

Abby's vision went in and out of focus. She glimpsed at least four attackers left standing. A distant part of her realized she was going to die here, on a random island, all her efforts for nothing. Worse, Lev... Lev. She couldn't see him from this angle. Please, she begged silently, let him be okay. Let this all be a nightmare.

Blackness crept at the edges of her sight as two figures loomed over her. One said something, and they grabbed Abby by her arms, beginning to drag her. She tried to struggle, but consciousness slipped like sand through her fingers. The last thing she remembered was the smear of blood on the ground, whether it was hers or Lev's, she couldn't tell, as darkness overtook her.
