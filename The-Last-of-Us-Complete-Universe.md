# The Last of Us Universe

## Introduction  
**_The Last of Us_** series presents a harrowing post-apocalyptic saga centered on the Cordyceps brain infection outbreak and the intertwined lives of its survivors. The story spans multiple decades, following characters through the collapse of society, the emergence of brutal factions, and deeply personal tales of love, loss, and revenge. Notably, creative director Neil Druckmann has described the first game as a story about **"love"** and the sequel as a story about **"hate,"** reflecting the shift in tone from the bond between protagonists to the cycle of violence that ensnares them. This is a full narrative that chronicles **_The Last of Us Part I_ (including the _Left Behind_ DLC) and _The Last of Us Part II_**, from the 2013 outbreak to the late 2030s, integrating all major story beats, character developments, in-game lore (notes, recordings, environmental storytelling), and relevant developer insights. Key factions and the stages of the infected are detailed in dedicated sections, and all information is grounded strictly in the game canon and official supplementary materials (such as the _American Dreams_ comics), **excluding the TV series adaptation**.

## Outbreak and the Fall of Society (2013)  
In September 2013, a mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus ignited a global pandemic. What began as isolated incidents of strange, violent behavior rapidly escalated into nationwide chaos as infected humans (host to the **Cordyceps Brain Infection, CBI**) attacked others, spreading the fungus. Normal life collapsed within days. On **September 26, 2013**, known in the series lore as "Outbreak Day", panic and confusion struck cities worldwide. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, single father **Joel Miller** spent his 32nd birthday witnessing the downfall of civilization. That night, as the outbreak reached Austin, Joel's neighbors and countless others became rabid "runners" shortly after infection. Joel fled with his 12-year-old daughter **Sarah** and younger brother **Tommy**, only to encounter military forces enforcing a quarantine. In a tragic turn, a panicked soldier shot at the fleeing family; Sarah was mortally wounded in Joel's arms. Joel's devastating loss set the tone for the dark years to come.

By early October 2013, the U.S. government responded with extreme measures. Major cities were locked down under martial law, the Defense Secretary authorized the military to assume control, enforcing curfews and "shoot on sight" orders in an attempt to contain the infection. The Federal Disaster Response Agency (**FEDRA**), effectively the remnants of the U.S. military, established fortified **Quarantine Zones (QZs)** in cities like Boston, Hartford, Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh. Surviving civilians were corralled into these zones under strict rule, while bombs were dropped on infected zones (like downtown Seattle) in desperate containment efforts. Despite these measures, by 2014 the World Health Organization estimated that over 60% of the world's population had been killed or infected. The American government effectively collapsed outside of the QZs, and isolated survivor enclaves or lawless areas filled the void.

Amidst the early chaos, new groups and legends arose. In late 2013, **Marlene**, a young woman in the Boston QZ, founded a militant resistance group called the **Fireflies**, vowing to restore government by toppling FEDRA's authoritarian control and seeking a cure for the infection. Their motto, *"When you're lost in the darkness, look for the light,"* appeared in graffiti across quarantine zones. The Fireflies orchestrated uprisings and sabotage against military rule, sparking hope in some and violent crackdowns by FEDRA. Meanwhile, in Seattle, a **mysterious woman** led a group of survivors in the suburban outskirts. They miraculously survived outside FEDRA control, and news reports dubbed it a miracle. This woman became revered as a **Prophet**; her followers eventually formed the religious cult known as the **Seraphites** (or "Scars") who rejected the old world's sins and FEDRA's commands. FEDRA forces discovered the Seraphite community in early 2014, but the group refused to be absorbed into the Seattle QZ, an act which only increased local legend about them.

*Environmental storytelling in the game reveals how swiftly ordinary life vanished.* For example, in **Lincoln, Massachusetts**, by October 2013 schools were closed and evacuation orders issued, but infected still overran those who stayed behind. In a suburban home later explored by Joel and Ellie, a poignant **evacuation letter** from a father instructs anyone who finds it to **"take care"** of the house if the family never returns, showing the hope people had that evacuations were temporary. Such artifacts underscore the abrupt transition from normalcy to a deadly new world.

## The Dark Years: Survival and Factions (2013–2033)  
The twenty years after Outbreak Day are largely unseen in the games, but in-game lore and dialogue piece together a picture of brutal survival and the formation of key factions. **Joel**, shattered by Sarah's death, became hardened and ruthless. In the early years, Joel and his brother **Tommy** stuck together, doing whatever it took to survive. They even fell in with desperate groups that ambushed others, becoming "**hunters**," as Joel bitterly admits later. This period created a rift between the brothers. Tommy, who retained more of his moral compass, grew tired of Joel's brutal pragmatism and **left to join the Fireflies** for a time. Joel, meanwhile, linked up with a savvy survivor named **Tess** in the Boston QZ. Joel and Tess became partners in the **smuggling underworld**, hoarding and trading contraband (weapons, drugs, etc.) across the quarantine zone's perimeters. In Boston's oppressive regime, characterized by food shortages and FEDRA's public executions of the infected or dissidents, black-market smugglers like Joel and Tess thrived by being ruthless and efficient.

In these years, other characters established their paths. **Bill**, a paranoid survivalist, fortified the small town of Lincoln, near Boston, turning it into a maze of booby traps and barricades. He and his partner **Frank** helped Joel and Tess procure supplies, running regular smuggling shipments to Boston, an arrangement documented in Tess's meticulous log books. At some point, Frank and Bill's relationship frayed; Frank longed for a life beyond Bill's isolated, fear-driven existence. (Frank's later farewell note bitterly tells Bill *"I hated your guts…Trying to leave this town will kill me. Still better than spending another day with you"*.) South of Boston, the **Hartford QZ** in Connecticut collapsed due to riots and infection around this time; survivors like **Henry** and **Sam** (two brothers from Hartford) became drifters after their zone's fall.

Tommy eventually became disillusioned with the Fireflies' methods and left that group as well. By the late 2020s, Tommy found his way to the **Wyoming wilderness**, where he and survivors (led by a man named **Maria** and her father) founded a safe community in the town of **Jackson**. Unlike the authoritarian QZs, Jackson was built on cooperation, its founders erected strong walls and revived power at a hydroelectric dam. Over years, Jackson grew into a **thriving settlement** with families, livestock, and some semblance of normal life. Tommy married Maria and became a key leader and lookout for Jackson. This hidden haven would later represent the hope for a civilized future.

Back in Boston, Marlene rose to be the Fireflies' regional commander. **Ellie Williams**, the daughter of Marlene's close friend **Anna**, grew up in the Boston quarantine zone during these harsh years. Ellie was born around **2008 or 2009 (canonically, 14 years before the events of 2033)**; her mother Anna, a nurse, lived long enough to deliver Ellie in 2019 but died within a day of giving birth. Anna wrote a heartfelt **letter to baby Ellie** urging her to find purpose and "make me proud," and entrusted Ellie's care to Marlene. Honoring that promise, Marlene placed Ellie in a FEDRA military boarding school for orphans inside the Boston QZ, believing it safest within the system. Ellie grew into a smart, rebellious teen who often got into fights at the oppressive boarding school. She kept with her a switchblade (Anna's keepsake) and her mother's letter, tangible links to a family she never knew.

**Riley Abel**, Ellie's best friend, was an older girl at the boarding school with a similarly defiant spirit. According to the _American Dreams_ prequel comics (written by Neil Druckmann), Ellie and 16-year-old Riley met around **2032/2033** when Ellie was 13. They bonded over their disdain for FEDRA's strict regime and snuck out of the school together in search of adventure. In those escapades, they encountered Firefly operatives and even Marlene herself. Marlene, surprised to realize Ellie was Anna's daughter, finally met Ellie and reluctantly gave Ellie the letter from her mother along with Anna's switchblade. She refused to recruit Ellie into the Fireflies (for her safety), instead instructing Ellie to remain at the school while Riley was drawn to the Fireflies' cause. This planted seeds of curiosity and trust in Ellie toward Marlene. Shortly thereafter, Riley *did* run away to join the Fireflies, disappearing from the school and leaving Ellie feeling abandoned.

Throughout the 2020s, **infected humans** continued to evolve through stages, becoming deadlier over time. Reports indicated that within a year or so, some infected progressed from mindless "runners" into **"stalkers"**, more hideously deformed creatures that could hide and ambush prey. After several years, the infection could produce **"clickers,"** named for the echo-locating clicks they use since the fungus renders them blind. Rarest of all, after a decade or more, infected could grow into towering **"bloaters,"** encrusted with armor-like fungal plates. These stages would all be encountered by the protagonists later, but they already populated the world in the interim, making travel outside QZs incredibly perilous. By the early 2030s, some remote areas (sewers, basements) harbored infected that had been alive since the outbreak, incubating horrifying mutations that most survivors hadn't even seen.

In summary, the two decades after the outbreak forged the principal characters' hardened personalities and set the stage for the events of the games: Joel emerged a cold, skilled survivor living day-to-day as a smuggler; Ellie grew up an orphan yearning for meaning and belonging; and the world settled into an uneasy status quo of fortified QZs, lawless ruins prowled by infected and bandits, and rebel enclaves like the Fireflies and Seraphites pushing back against the remaining authorities. By 2033, all the pieces were in place for a fateful meeting that would forever change the course of this broken world.

## 2033: The Smuggling Mission (Summer)  
In **Summer 2033**, Joel is a smuggler in the Boston QZ, now in his late 40s. He and Tess maintain a ruthless reputation in the Boston underworld. At this time, Boston is under strict martial law, FEDRA's soldiers police the streets, conduct daily public executions of infected citizens, and struggle to contain an underground Firefly rebellion. rations are scarce (Boston had endured *"multiple half-ration weeks"* due to supply shortages), and unrest simmers. Joel and Tess's routine involves trading contraband and taking on dirty jobs. One such job goes awry when an arms dealer named **Robert** double-crosses them, stealing a cache of weapons and intending to sell it to the Fireflies. Tess, furious at being cheated, fights through Robert's thugs and captures Robert in a dockside warehouse. Joel and Tess execute Robert to settle the score.

As they kill Robert, **Marlene** arrives on the scene, wounded from a Firefly clash with FEDRA. It turns out Marlene had bought those stolen guns from Robert to supply her Fireflies. Confronting Joel and Tess, Marlene recognizes their capabilities and strikes a desperate deal: she'll return their weapons (and then some) if Joel and Tess smuggle something **out of the QZ** for her. That "something" turns out to be a someone, **14-year-old Ellie**. Marlene reveals that the Fireflies have been trying to secretly transport Ellie out of Boston. (Just days earlier, Riley had snuck back into the QZ to visit Ellie at their old mall hideout. During that reunion, depicted in the _Left Behind_ DLC, the girls were bitten by infected while playing in the closed mall. Riley lost her life, but Ellie did **not** turn, which astonished Marlene's group. They realized Ellie's **immunity** could be the key to a vaccine. Marlene had intended to escort Ellie west to a Firefly science team but was injured in a firefight, necessitating Joel and Tess's help.) With time short and Fireflies dead or scattered, Marlene entrusts Ellie to these two seasoned smugglers, hoping they can deliver the girl to a Firefly rendezvous outside the city.

Joel initially wants nothing to do with "baby-sitting" a kid, but Tess, sensing something important, accepts the job. That night, **Joel, Tess, and Ellie slip out of the Boston QZ** under cover of darkness and pouring rain. They sneak through wrecked buildings and tunnels, evading search lights and soldiers. Ellie is delighted just to be outside the walls for the first time, though Joel is all business. Soon they discover FEDRA has raised the alert, the authorities know a high-value asset (Ellie) is missing and impose a lockdown. The trio encounters a military patrol. When a soldier scans them for infection, Ellie panics and stabs him, leading to a firefight. In the chaos, Tess sees the scanner read **positive for infection** on Ellie. Ellie then hurriedly reveals her secret: she was bitten weeks ago but hasn't turned, claiming she's immune and that the Fireflies believe she's the key to a cure. Joel is skeptical and shaken by this revelation, but Tess believes Ellie (the bite mark on Ellie's arm is clearly old and scarred, not a fresh infection). With new resolve, Tess insists they push on to meet the Firefly contact. They traverse ruined downtown Boston, passing through an old museum teeming with infected, including their first encounter with deadly **Clickers** (Ellie witnesses firsthand how Joel can kill these monsters with shivs and guns). 

By dawn, the trio reaches the **Massachusetts State House (Capitol Building)**, the arranged meetup point. They find a massacre, the Firefly escort team lies dead, having been ambushed by FEDRA troops or infected. With no backup and soldiers closing in, Tess shockingly **reveals she's been bitten** during the museum incident. The infection is spreading fast in Tess; knowing she has only hours (if that) before turning, she makes a final stand. In an emotional plea, Tess begs Joel to **take Ellie west to find the remaining Fireflies**, believing Ellie's immunity must mean something: *"She's real… I need you to get her to Tommy's… he used to run with this group"* (Tess knows Tommy was once a Firefly). Joel resists, he's anguished by losing another partner, but Tess, with her last breath, **sacrifices herself**. As FEDRA soldiers storm the building, Tess uses her own life as a distraction: she guns down one soldier and is killed in the return fire, or (in some retellings) blows herself up along with nearby infected, buying Joel and Ellie time to escape. Joel drags a reluctant Ellie away as Tess's final act keeps the soldiers occupied. Tess's death cements Joel's bitterness but also forces him onto a new path with Ellie. Joel and Ellie are now an unlikely duo on a cross-country quest that neither fully wanted, yet Tess's dying wish compels Joel forward.

*Character moment:* This is a turning point for Joel. Up to now, he treated Ellie as "cargo," pointedly avoiding learning about her. But with Tess gone, Joel is now solely responsible for Ellie. Tess's faith that **"this kid could be our cure"** weighs on him. Ellie feels profound guilt for Tess's death ("It's *because* of me," she says, to which Joel curtly replies, "Tess made a choice"). He decides to honor Tess's last request. His plan: find Tommy, his Firefly-connected brother, who might know where to go. Thus, Joel and Ellie truly begin their journey westward.

## The Journey West (Fall 2033, The Last of Us Part I)  

### Across the Ruins (Summer 2033)  
Leaving Boston, Joel and Ellie head into the ruins of New England. They need a car to travel further. Tess had mentioned Joel's smuggling contact **Bill** in Lincoln, who owed them favors. Joel detours with Ellie to the small town of **Lincoln**. As they approach, they witness Bill's handiwork: the streets are littered with makeshift defenses, barbed fences, tripwires, nail-bombs, and **triggered infected traps** (one snare hoists Joel upside-down, forcing Ellie to cut him down while he fends off infected). Ellie proves resourceful, covering Joel when he's vulnerable and retrieving tools as instructed. They eventually meet **Bill** himself, a cranky, armed man in a gas mask who reluctantly rescues them from a pack of infected. Bill is hostile at first, handcuffing Ellie to avoid surprises, but Joel convinces him to help by invoking their past dealings. Bill agrees to help Joel **acquire a working vehicle**, grumbling about how much Joel "owes him" later.

Bill leads them through his booby-trapped town (Ellie marvels at a functioning truck barricade and Bill's paranoid preparations). Along the way, environmental details hint at Bill's story: an **empty ex-partner's house**, a note about keeping town clear, and Bill's muttered references to someone named Frank. Bill bluntly warns Joel that traveling with Ellie is a bad idea: *"Once upon a time I had somebody I cared about… and in this world that kinda shit'll kill ya"*, indicating he lost Frank due to attachment. This foreshadows Joel's own inner fears. 

To find a car, Bill directs them to **Lincoln High School**, where a military truck crashed long ago. They scavenge for a **car battery** inside the school. This section is fraught with infected. In the school's gym, they are attacked by a hulking **Bloater**, a rare stage-4 infected covered in fungal armor. Joel and Bill manage to gun it down (or Joel uses makeshift nail bombs Bill provided). Ellie witnesses how deadly the long-term infected can be, as the Bloater can rip a person apart. After defeating it, they discover the battery is gone, someone already looted it. Overrun by infected, the trio escapes into a nearby house through a window.

Inside the house, they make a grim discovery: **Frank's corpse**. Frank, Bill's partner, had hung himself after being bitten, one of his legs shows a human bite mark, indicating he was infected. A **suicide note from Frank** on the desk reveals his feelings: he **"grew tired"** of Bill's control and isolation, and even mocks Bill's constant fear of leaving town, writing *"Guess you were right. Trying to leave this town will kill me"*. Frank had earlier stolen the car battery and installed it in a pickup in this garage, intending to flee Lincoln. Bill is visibly shaken reading Frank's last words, Frank essentially died hating him. (If the player gives Bill the note, Bill curses Frank angrily and throws it away, though it's clear he's hurt.) Despite the bitter end to their relationship, Frank unwittingly provided Joel and Ellie a means to continue: the truck in the garage is now working with the charged battery. After fending off one last swarm of infected attracted by the noise, Joel, Ellie, and Bill take the truck and speed out of Lincoln's gate. Bill stays behind, alone again. Before parting, he gruffly tells Joel *"You keep her alive, and you set right all the shit I did."* It's half accusation, half advice born of regret. Ellie quietly pockets Frank's note (if Joel didn't show Bill) as they drive off, one more story of love and loss imprinted on her.

Now driving, Joel and Ellie make relatively good progress heading west along the interstate. During calmer moments, Ellie finds a **cassette tape** in the truck and plays it, it's Hank Williams, prompting Joel to reminisce briefly (Ellie jokes that the song is "before my time"). She also finds a gay porn magazine in Bill's stash, teasing Joel with naive questions until she laughs and tosses it out the window. These lighthearted exchanges show Ellie starting to crack Joel's shell. But danger is never far on the open road.

### Pittsburgh: The Hunters' Ambush (Early Fall 2033)  
As they enter the outskirts of **Pittsburgh**, Pennsylvania, the road is blocked by abandoned cars. Joel tries to detour through the city. In a now-infamous scene, Ellie observes a somber **quarantine evacuation bus** pileup and moments later they encounter a **wounded man** stumbling in the road, pleading for help. Joel's survival instincts kick in, he accelerates instead. *"He ain't even hurt,"* Joel mutters. Indeed, it's a trap: the "injured" man suddenly pulls a gun, and other attackers roll a bus into their truck. Joel and Ellie crash inside the city. They've fallen into the clutches of **Pittsburgh's Hunters**, a large group of ruthless survivors who **overthrew the military quarantine zone** and now control the city, preying on anyone who enters. (One collectible diary later found in Pittsburgh details how, after FEDRA's rations ran low, the citizens revolted, **lynched the soldiers**, and proudly declared the QZ theirs, only to devolve into banditry. Checkpoints are strewn with **"ambush maps"** and piles of burned civilian luggage, evidence of how thoroughly the Hunters loot and kill their victims.)

Joel and Ellie fight their way through ruined hotels, streets, and a flooded financial district overrun with the Hunters. Though outnumbered, Joel's combat experience sees them through brutal encounters. Ellie saves Joel's life for the first time here: as Joel is nearly drowned by a Hunter, Ellie picks up his fallen pistol and shoots the attacker in the head. This act is a turning point for her, it's the first human life she takes (in the main story) and it shakes her, but she steels herself quickly. Joel initially chastises her for taking such a risk, then acknowledges she handled herself well. He decides to start **teaching Ellie how to use a rifle**, allowing her to cover him from a sniper perch in a next skirmish (reflecting Joel's grudging acceptance that she can contribute to their survival).

Navigating through the city, Joel and Ellie stumble upon hideouts and notes that provide glimpses into Pittsburgh's savagery. In one hideout, a **Hunters' ledger** lists countless ambush kills, including families and children, chilling Ellie with the realization that not all survivors are good people. Another artifact, **"Truck Note,"** reveals the Hunters recently captured a military armored vehicle (a "Humvee" with a mounted turret) and have been using it to patrol and terrorize anyone in the area. This armored truck becomes a recurring threat: as Joel and Ellie slip through alleys, the **Humvee** roams the streets hunting them, its loudspeaker blaring insults and its turret spraying bullets.

During their escape, Joel and Ellie cross paths with two other survivors: **Henry** (in his mid-20s) and his younger brother **Sam** (around 13). Henry and Sam had been part of a survivor group from the fallen Hartford QZ, looking to join a Firefly encampment out west. They entered Pittsburgh by mistake and were ambushed like Joel and Ellie. Now trapped, Henry is desperate to protect Sam. Initially, Henry holds Joel at gunpoint in a hideout, suspicious of strangers, but both sides quickly realize they're not from the hostile faction and that cooperation is their best chance. Henry reveals a plan: he knows of a Firefly safe house outside the city; if they can get out of Pittsburgh, they can head for it. Joel agrees to team up. 

Working together, the four of them traverse an area known as **"Escape from the City"**, timing their moves to avoid the roving Humvee. At one point, they all stealthily take down a sniper nest that was pinning them down. Henry proves resourceful and careful, while Sam and Ellie quickly bond (they share jokes and talk about toys and comics they like). Ellie's demeanor brightens around someone close to her age, a brief respite from the violence. She and Sam find an **abandoned toy store**, and Ellie notices Sam eying a robot toy. Henry insists to Sam they pack only essentials, so Sam leaves the toy, but Ellie later secretly puts it in her backpack to give to him, a touching detail showing her empathy.

The group's escape route leads through an old **sewer system** that had been converted into a hideout by another group long ago. Inside, they discover eerie, poignant evidence of that group: notes and childlike drawings left behind by a man named **Ish** and his companions. Through a series of **artifacts (Ish's notes, drawings, and a survivor's diary)**, Joel and Ellie (and the player) piece together one of the most memorable subplots of environmental lore: 

- **Ish's Story:** Ish was a fisherman who survived the initial outbreak at sea. When he came ashore near Pittsburgh months later, he took refuge in the sewers. Over time, Ish befriended other survivors (a family with two children, among them a man named **Kyle** and a woman **Susan**) and invited them into his safe haven. They turned the sealed sewer rooms into a **thriving community**, setting up living quarters, a rainwater collection system, and even a makeshift school for the kids. A crayon drawing on the wall shows Ish and his friend **Danny** as protectors in improvised armor, indicating how they defended their small society. However, one day a door was accidentally left ajar, allowing a horde of infected to pour in. The community was decimated in an instant. Ish's last notes describe the chaos and guilt: many, including children, were slaughtered. A heartbreaking **"Kid's Drawing"** shows children with their protectors before the tragedy, and a **note from Kyle** (found in the suburbs later) implies he hid the kids and considered poisoning them to spare them from being torn apart. Ish, Susan, and a few children managed to escape into the connecting suburbs, barricading the sewer door behind them. Their final fate is unknown, Ish and the survivors vanished, leaving only these traces of hope and sorrow. **This saga illustrates a microcosm of the world's brutality**: even the best attempts at rebuilding civilization can be undone by one mistake. Joel quietly empathizes with Ish's failure, perhaps reflecting on his own losses. Ellie is struck by a child's skeleton they find with a **"Father's note"** in a locked room where some made a last stand, the note apologizes to a group of kids for failing to protect them.

After navigating the infected-infested sewers (where Joel's group encounters both Clickers and Stalkers lurking from Ish's incident), they emerge into the **outskirts suburbs of Pittsburgh**. Initially relieved, their hope is short-lived. As they traverse the suburb streets, the **Hunters' armored Humvee** reappears, relentlessly pursuing them through yards. A running battle ensues. Eventually, Joel manages to destroy the turret truck by using an explosive or well-placed shots when it's vulnerable, ending the Hunter threat once and for all. However, in the aftermath, tragedy strikes within the group: during the chaos, a lurking infected had **bitten Sam** on the leg, a fact he keeps secret. That night, holed up in a suburban house, Sam grows quiet and withdrawn. Ellie tries to comfort him, giving him the toy robot she saved and talking about fears. Sam asks Ellie, *"Are you ever scared?"* After some thought, Ellie answers that she fears **"ending up alone."** Sam, clearly hiding his bite, comments on whether people still have their humanity after turning. The next morning, when Ellie goes to fetch Sam for breakfast, he has **fully turned** and attacks her. Sam's infection was too advanced overnight. Joel and Henry rush in as Ellie wrestles with the feral Sam. **Henry is forced to shoot his own brother** to save Ellie. The shock of this act unravels Henry's will to live, in a split second, he points the gun at a stunned Joel, then turns it on himself. **Henry commits suicide**, unable to cope with what he had to do. Ellie watches, horrified, as another set of friends are lost in an instant. The screen fades with the onset of fall. This gut-wrenching sequence cements Ellie's trauma and Joel's growing protectiveness (he tries to console Henry right before the suicide, to no avail). It also underscores the game's theme: even momentary connections can end in devastating loss, fueling the survivor's guilt in Ellie that will haunt her. The camera lingers on Sam's toy robot, now lying forgotten, a symbol of stolen childhood.

### Wyoming Reunion (Fall 2033)  
The story resumes in the **fall of 2033**, weeks after the Pittsburgh incident. Joel and Ellie have traveled on foot (and briefly by truck until it broke down) across the country. They arrive in **Jackson County, Wyoming**, not far from Tommy's last known location. The autumnal forests and mountains are picturesque, a stark contrast to the urban ruins they left. Ellie tries to lighten the mood with her **book of puns**, but the recent tragedy still hangs between them; Joel remains mostly quiet, though his attitude toward Ellie is noticeably more caring than at the start.

Joel's goal is to find Tommy, believing Tommy can direct them to any Firefly research site given his prior membership. They follow the river toward a **hydroelectric dam** that supplies power to a nearby settlement. By chance, at this **Jackson County Hydroelectric Plant**, Joel and Ellie finally reunite with **Tommy**. A group of riders (the Jackson community's scouts) initially hold Joel and Ellie at gunpoint, suspecting them of being looters or infected. Among them is **Maria** (Tommy's wife). When Tommy recognizes Joel, the tension breaks and the brothers embrace warmly. It's a rare moment of joy for Joel. He introduces Ellie to Tommy and Maria; Maria is polite but guarded, as she's protective of Tommy and wary of Joel's dangerous life.

Joel and Tommy haven't seen each other in years, so Tommy excitedly shows Joel around the dam, explaining how his community managed to get the turbines working (providing electricity to their township, lights, heating, even movies on occasion). The Jackson community is described as having around 20 families, with plans to move into the town itself now that power is restored. It represents a functioning society: they have crops, livestock, and a secure perimeter patrolled by watchmen. Ellie marvels at this slice of normalcy.

However, under the surface, Joel and Tommy's reunion is complicated. Joel, thinking only of his mission, privately asks Tommy to **take Ellie off his hands and continue the journey to the Fireflies**. Joel insists that Ellie's immune and that **Fireflies out west (possibly at the University of Eastern Colorado) need to examine her**. Tommy is shocked at the news of immunity. He's torn; he owes Joel (for past events Joel alludes to, and Joel did save Tommy's life many times), but Tommy has also built a new life and *promised Maria not to venture off recklessly again*. This conflict erupts when bandits (raiders from outside) suddenly attack the dam. Joel, Tommy, and Ellie fight alongside Maria and the others to repel the raid. Ellie even saves Maria at one point if needed, proving her capability. After the skirmish, Tommy confronts Joel about the real reason Joel came. Sensing Joel is truly afraid for Ellie's fate (and perhaps recognizing Joel's growing parental feelings), Tommy agrees to help. He will take Ellie to the Fireflies at the University, allowing Joel to return to Jackson and live a safer life. Joel initially accepts this plan and tells Ellie they'll go their separate ways.

Ellie, however, has reached a breaking point. Overhearing part of their exchange, she **runs away**, stealing a horse from the stables. Joel and Tommy chase her to an old ranch house in the woods. Inside, Joel finds Ellie in an upstairs bedroom reading a teenage girl's diary left from before the outbreak. Ellie confronts Joel in one of the most emotional scenes of the game: *"I'm not her, you know."* Joel, startled, asks what she's talking about. Ellie continues, referencing Sarah obliquely: *"Maria told me about Sarah.** I know about your daughter."* Joel, defensive and pained, snaps **"You are treading on some mighty thin ice."** Ellie presses on, tears in her eyes, *"Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me, everyone ***except for you!*** ... So don't tell me I'd be safer with someone else, because the truth is I'd just be more scared."* This raw admission lays bare Ellie's greatest fear (ending up alone) and forces Joel to confront his own emotional walls. Joel responds angrily that Ellie is right, he isn't her father and tomorrow he will hand her over to Tommy. The argument is cut short by attacking bandits who tracked them. Joel and Ellie fight their way out together, an unspoken apology in their coordination.

By the time they return to the dam, Joel has reflected on Ellie's words. Realizing he does care for Ellie like a daughter and that abandoning her would betray Tess's last wish (and his own heart), Joel **changes his mind**. He tells Tommy that he will **continue the journey with Ellie himself**, relieving Tommy of the burden. Tommy understands and provides Joel and Ellie with supplies, a horse (Ellie nicknames the horse "Callus"), and directions to the Fireflies' last known base: the **University of Eastern Colorado** (UEC). As they depart, Joel and Ellie's bond is stronger than ever, they've openly faced the fact that they need each other. Riding out, Joel even lightens the mood by awkwardly explaining the rules of college football to Ellie (a charming bit of optional dialogue). This segment in Jackson County highlights **Joel's character growth**: from trying to ditch Ellie as "cargo" to willingly embracing the duty of caring for her. It also introduces a beacon of hope (Jackson's community) that looms in the future, showing what Joel will later seek to protect at all costs.

### University of Eastern Colorado (Late Fall 2033)  
Joel and Ellie journey by horseback to the University of Eastern Colorado in the mountains of Colorado. They arrive in late fall, with golden leaves on the campus grounds. The university was supposedly the Fireflies' new research location. Indeed, they find signs of recent Firefly presence: painted logos on walls and barricades. Ellie quips about college life as they explore (joking she'll enroll). The campus, however, appears deserted. Searching the dorms and science buildings, Joel and Ellie piece together through recordings and documents that the Fireflies **abruptly evacuated this base**. A **Firefly recorder** left by a surgeon or scientist indicates they had a breakthrough in finding someone immune (**implying Marlene's message about Ellie**), but due to constant danger and perhaps relocation plans, they packed up. The recorder mentions they've moved to **St. Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah**, a more secure location where the Firefly science team is regrouping. Joel deduces that Salt Lake City is their next destination, as it likely houses the lab that can create a cure from Ellie.

Before they can leave, they encounter a group of **raiders (bandits)** who have infiltrated the campus, these might be scavengers from a nearby town (the timeline notes they came from **David's group in Silver Lake** searching for supplies). A fight ensues as Joel and Ellie try to escape. In the chaos, Joel is grievously injured: while fighting a raider in a struggle, Joel falls over a broken railing and **is impaled on a piece of rebar** sticking out of the ground. He yanks himself off the metal rod, but the wound is catastrophic, Joel is bleeding heavily from the abdomen. Despite dizziness and pain, Joel manages to get back on the horse with Ellie's frantic help, and they flee the pursuing attackers. The screen fades as Joel, pale and barely conscious, slumps and falls off the horse, collapsing in the snow. Ellie panics, calling out his name. Joel's fate is uncertain as winter arrives.

## Winter 2033–34: "Left Behind" and the Cannibals  
**Ellie** takes center stage in the winter segment, as Joel is incapacitated. The game shifts to her perspective, highlighting her growth and resilience. She has sheltered Joel in an abandoned mountain resort and done her best to treat his wound, but Joel is gravely ill (running a fever from infection, sepsis, due to the impalement). They hide in the **Lakeside Resort**, a snow-covered collection of cabins and a small town, hoping to wait out Joel's recovery. Ellie, low on food and medicine, ventures out **hunting** a deer in the forest. This is a pivotal moment demonstrating Ellie's survival skills (taught by Joel): she manages to wound a deer and tracks its blood through the woods.

Ellie's deer trail is intercepted by two strangers, **David** and **James**, who claim to be from a nearby group of survivors. David is polite, warm-voiced, and offers to trade for the deer. Skeptical and alone, Ellie holds them at gunpoint. She ends up striking a deal: David will send James to fetch **penicillin** (medicine Ellie desperately needs for Joel) in exchange for a share of the meat. While James is gone, Ellie and David take shelter in an old cabin as night falls…and waves of infected, drawn by the deer's blood scent, attack. Ellie and David fight **side by side** to survive a harrowing onslaught of runners and clickers (this is the first time Ellie battles such a horde alone, and she proves incredibly capable). David uses a revolver and rifle with deadly aim, showing he's experienced. Impressed with Ellie, David remarks she handled herself like few adults could. As they catch their breath, David reveals he's the leader of a group of **survivors holed up in an old town (Silver Lake)** not far. Then, in a chilling twist, he drops a bombshell: he recounts how some of his men were killed *"by a crazy man traveling with a little girl"* not long ago, **revealing he knows who Ellie is** and that Joel killed members of his group at the university. James returns with the medicine, pointing a gun at Ellie (clearly, they'd considered ambushing her). But David astonishingly lets Ellie leave with the penicillin, telling James to lower the gun. *"No, let her go,"* David says, *"…it's not your fault. That's just the way things are."* He ominously adds as Ellie backs away, *"See you real soon, Ellie."* David's calm demeanor masks dark intentions.

Ellie races back to the garage where Joel lies feverish and barely alive. She injects him with penicillin and over the next day nurses him as best she can, bringing water and keeping him warm. Joel eventually falls into a stable sleep, but remains extremely weak. The reprieve doesn't last, David's men track Ellie to the hideout, having followed her horse's tracks in the snow. Ellie realizes David likely sent a posse after her. Determined to protect Joel, she **draws the attackers away**, leading them on horseback through the forest. In the chase, the horse is shot and Ellie tumbles off. She flees on foot, using stealth and her bow to pick off a few of David's men in the snowy woods and empty cabins. Nonetheless, Ellie is outnumbered and eventually gets captured by David.

Ellie awakens in a **holding cell (a metal cage)** back in David's settlement at Silver Lake. She immediately notices **human remains**, a dismembered corpse on a butcher's table, and realizes with horror that David's community **are cannibals**. (It's implied that not all members know; David's closest men harvest bodies from their casualties or waylaid strangers to feed their group through the winter famine, telling others it's "venison"). David attempts a gentle approach with Ellie, bringing her food and trying to recruit her. He admits he's impressed by her bravery and skill, and in an unsettling speech, he says *"You're special, Ellie… I can see how smart you are. We could use someone like you."* It becomes clear David has a twisted personal interest in her, beyond seeing her as a potential resource. Ellie fiercely rebuffs him at every turn. When David places his hand on the cage, Ellie breaks the predator's veneer by **violently breaking his finger** while snarling **"Ellie"**, giving him her name only to punctuate that "*Ellie* is the little girl that broke your fucking finger!". Enraged, David and James drag Ellie out to execute her, deciding she's too much trouble. On the table, Ellie desperately reveals **"I'm infected!"** and bites David's hand in the struggle. This shocks them momentarily, giving Ellie the split-second to kill James with a meat cleaver and escape. Now armed with a machete and her wits, **Ellie is in a fight for her life** as David stalks her through the burning remains of a steakhouse (Ellie had ignited a fire). In a tense cat-and-mouse sequence amid flames, Ellie finally **ambushes David and kills him** in an explosion of rage, she slashes him repeatedly with the machete even after he's down, screaming in trauma and fury. This is a defining moment for Ellie: it's the most brutal thing she's ever done, and it's to a man who tried to violate and murder her. The ordeal leaves her profoundly shaken.

Meanwhile, a gravely wounded **Joel awakens** in the hideout, recovering just enough strength thanks to Ellie's care. He finds Ellie gone and discovers evidence of David's men. Summoning a last surge of will, Joel sets out to find Ellie. He **captures two of David's men** and, in a grim echo of his old ruthless self, **tortures them for information** on Ellie's whereabouts, impaling one and brutalizing the other to ensure their honesty. (This scene is an uncomfortable reminder of Joel's dark capabilities; he shows no mercy, killing them after extracting what he needs, muttering "I believed him" that they told the truth about Ellie's location.) With the information, Joel heads to Silver Lake. He arrives just as Ellie has killed David. Ellie, hysterical and covered in blood, doesn't recognize Joel at first when he grabs her. She struggles, screaming, until she realizes it's him. Joel holds her tightly in an embrace, calling her **"baby girl"**, the same term of endearment he once used for Sarah. It's a heart-rending reunion: Ellie dissolves into sobs as Joel comforts her, saying "It's okay, I got you." This moment cements their father-daughter bond. **Joel and Ellie have saved each other in different ways**: Ellie kept Joel alive through the winter, and Joel rescued Ellie from unspeakable horror. The snow thaws, leading into spring.

*(Aside: During this Winter segment, the _Left Behind_ DLC interweaves an earlier flashback of Ellie with Riley. At points when Ellie is caring for Joel, the game flashes back to a few weeks *before* Ellie met Joel, in the Boston mall where Ellie and Riley had their last adventure. In that flashback, after Riley returned to say goodbye (intending to leave Boston with the Fireflies), Ellie and Riley spent a night of fun in the abandoned mall, taking photos in a photo booth, having a water gun fight, riding a carousel, and dancing to music in a Halloween costume shop. It's a rare moment of pure joy for Ellie. Overcome by emotion, Ellie kissed Riley, revealing their romantic feelings. Soon after, the infected swarmed the mall (drawn by the noise) and both girls were bitten. They decided to *"lose their minds together,"* but tragically Riley turned and Ellie did not. This backstory adds depth to Ellie's character: Riley's death is the root of Ellie's survivor guilt and fear of ending up alone. In the winter present, as Ellie fights to save Joel, she remembers Riley's words about fighting for every moment of life, which motivates her not to give up. The DLC also includes a scene of Ellie desperately scavenging a **medical helicopter** for supplies to treat Joel, tying back to her resourcefulness and determination. These interwoven flashbacks underscore Ellie's loyalty and the theme of **love and loss**: she couldn't save Riley, but she will do everything to save Joel. End of DLC flashback.)*

## Spring 2034: The Firefly Lab (Saint Mary's Hospital)  
The final leg of Joel and Ellie's journey takes them to **Salt Lake City, Utah** in the spring of 2034. Joel has healed significantly by the time they arrive (his shoulder and abdomen are scarred, but he's fit enough to travel). In contrast to the dread of winter, spring brings a bittersweet hope. They near their destination: **St. Mary's Hospital**, where the Fireflies are supposedly ready to create a cure from Ellie's immunity.

As they traverse Salt Lake City's flooded streets and highways, the game gives one of its most iconic moments of beauty: Ellie spots a **giraffe** grazing among the overgrown city ruins. A whole small herd is roaming free, escaped from the zoo. Ellie, who has been noticeably quiet and distant since the trauma with David, lights up in childlike wonder. Joel boosts her up to pet the giraffe. Together they stand on a balcony watching the giraffes in a sunlit skyline, a rare tranquil moment. Joel in this moment actually suggests to Ellie that *"we don't have to do this"*, after everything, they could turn back to Tommy's settlement and live out their days. It shows Joel has grown to love Ellie so much that he fears losing her to whatever the Fireflies might do. But Ellie insists on seeing it through: *"After all we've been through… it can't be for nothing."* She feels she must honor Riley, Tess, Sam, and all the others lost along the way by delivering a potential cure. Joel respects her wish. 

Before entering the hospital zone, Ellie gives Joel a gift: **a photo of him and Sarah** taken long ago. (Tommy had tried to give this photo to Joel back in Jackson, but Joel initially refused to take it. Ellie secretly kept it and now offers it to Joel.) Joel, moved, finally accepts the photo and with it, the memory of his daughter. It symbolizes Joel making peace with his past, a crucial step enabled by Ellie's companionship.

They proceed through an old bus depot and underground tunnels flooded with spores and infected. Here, Joel fully trusts Ellie in combat, working seamlessly with her to take down Clickers and Bloaters. He even jokes about teaching her to swim someday (since Ellie never learned and nearly drowned earlier). Their relationship is at its peak of warmth; in optional conversations Joel talks about what they'll do after this, maybe **sheep ranching** or **teaching Ellie guitar** (he's kept his promise and has been teaching her slowly; music is a shared hope for the future).

As they near the hospital, disaster strikes: while helping Ellie cross a flooded area, Joel is knocked out underwater and Ellie, who cannot swim, **almost drowns**. Joel frantically pulls her to shore inside the freeway tunnel near the hospital. He's performing CPR when Firefly soldiers arrive and crack him in the head with a rifle, assuming Ellie is infected or dead. Everything goes black.

Joel awakens in a hospital bed, disoriented, under armed guard. **Marlene** is there, she made it across the country and is overseeing the Firefly operation. Marlene thanks Joel and marvels that he kept Ellie alive against all odds. Joel, groggy, asks about Ellie. Marlene's face grows somber. She reveals that the doctors have been running tests on unconscious Ellie and determined that the fungal growth in Ellie's brain mutated in a way that produces an **enzyme that counters the Cordyceps**. They believe they can reverse-engineer a cure for the infection from Ellie. However, to do that, they must **remove the infected portion of her brain**, inevitably killing her. Joel's face falls as Marlene quietly confirms: *"Ellie will die for this."* Joel immediately objects and demands to see Ellie, but Marlene gestures to the guards. She has Joel's pack and weapons taken and orders two soldiers to escort him out to the highway and *"if he tries anything, shoot him."* Marlene struggles with this decision, Ellie is like family to her, and Anna (Ellie's mom) was her best friend. A recorder nearby later reveals Marlene's private agony: she laments having to sacrifice Ellie, but feels she has no other choice for the greater good, and even "promises" Anna's memory that **Ellie's death won't be in vain**. Marlene asks Joel what Anna would do, saying *"You know this is what she'd want."* Joel, trembling with emotion, says nothing as he's escorted out.

Once in the corridor, Joel makes his choice in an instant: as they march him out, he **overpowers the Firefly guards**. In a visceral sequence, Joel goes on a rampage through the hospital to save Ellie. The game doesn't shy from showing Joel's willingness to kill the very people he's been seeking all year, all to save the girl he's come to love as a daughter. He battles through Firefly soldiers (former U.S. military and volunteers). There are audio logs the player can find on the way: one from a Firefly **surgeon** details how he's the only qualified doctor left to possibly make a cure and that it's been *"at least five years since the Fireflies formed"* in this struggle. The urgency in their mission is clear, yet for Joel, nothing matters but Ellie. **Developer insight:** Druckmann has explained that by putting the player in Joel's perspective here, they become *"complicit"* in his actions, it's meant to be uncomfortable but driven by love.

Joel finally bursts into the **operating room** just as the lead surgeon, **Dr. Jerry Anderson**, is about to begin Ellie's brain surgery. Jerry picks up a scalpel and tries to stop Joel. In gameplay, Joel is forced to **kill the surgeon** (the player can't progress otherwise). The other assistants cower as Joel disconnects Ellie from the machines. (Notably, that surgeon was **Abby's father**, a fact only fully revealed in Part II. Abby was present in the hospital; a flashback in Part II shows her discovering her father's corpse, forming the basis of her vendetta. In that scene, Abby tearfully tells him she would have supported his decision, saying *"I'd want you to do the surgery [if it were me]."* This tragic intersection of Joel's and Abby's stories is what triggers Part II's cycle of revenge.)

Joel carries the unconscious Ellie (wearing only a hospital gown) through the corridors. Marlene intercepts him at the elevator to the parking garage. She trains a gun on Joel and pleads with him to stop: *"You can't save her! Even if you get her out of here, what will you do, keep her safe forever?** How long till she's torn apart by infected or raiders when she grows up?** It's not your decision to make, nor mine… This is what she'd want. You know it."* Marlene desperately tries to appeal to Joel's love for Ellie, arguing *"We're the only ones who can save humanity. This is the chance we've been waiting for."* Joel, eyes cold and resolute, shakes his head. *"*Maybe*,"* he says, *"but you just come after her."* In one swift motion, Joel **shoots Marlene**, mortally wounding her. He then finishes her off with a point-blank shot as she begs for Ellie's life. Marlene's death is brutal but, in Joel's mind, necessary to ensure no one pursues them.

Some time later, Ellie awakens in the back seat of a car, groggy from anesthesia, as they are driving back toward Jackson. Joel has managed to find a vehicle (likely the one Marlene intended to transport the cure sample). Ellie asks what happened. In a **monumental lie**, Joel tells her: *"The Fireflies… they ran some tests on you. Turns out there are **dozens** of people like you, immune. And they've actually stopped looking for a cure. They've given up on it."* Ellie is stunned, her purpose, her sacrifice, all for nothing? She asks quietly if anyone was hurt. Joel replies only: *"Yes…*"* and that he had to get them out. He does not mention Marlene or the massacre. Ellie turns away, trying to process this heartbreaking news, as Joel drives on with a hollow expression. 

They eventually arrive on the outskirts of **Jackson**. The plan is to live in Tommy's community. As they hike the last stretch on foot through the woods to the settlement, Ellie is noticeably quiet and conflicted. Before they go join Tommy, Ellie stops Joel. She clearly has lingering doubts about what Joel told her. In a somber tone, Ellie reveals her **survivor's guilt** to Joel, she recounts Riley's death, Tess's, Sam's, all the loss that she feels *should* have been her. *"My life has to mean something,"* she says, voice trembling. Finally, she looks Joel in the eye and pointedly asks: **"Swear to me. Swear to me that everything you said about the Fireflies is true."** This is the moment of truth. Joel, without flinching, responds: **"I swear."** Ellie studies his face. After a painfully long pause, she simply says: **"…Okay."** The camera lingers on Ellie's troubled expression. It's ambiguous whether she believes him or is forcing herself to accept the lie out of love (the player can sense she is unconvinced, but she chooses not to challenge him further). With that, _The Last of Us Part I_ ends. Joel has saved Ellie's life but at the cost of condemning humanity's hope, a morally divisive act that he did out of absolute love. **Developer commentary:** Druckmann has noted that most players understood Joel's choice even if they disagreed, because the game builds that parental bond strongly. Joel could not lose another daughter, no matter the cost. 

This ending is left intentionally grey. It raises profound questions: Was Joel right to do what he did? Did Ellie truly want to die for a chance at a cure? *The game's epilogue offers no clear answer, only the tension in Ellie's **"Okay"** that suggests this lie will define their future.* 

*Insight:* Halley Gross, co-writer of Part II, explained that Ellie is *"haunted by what Abby took away [Joel], and also, we come to realize, haunted by what happened to her relationship with Joel after he told her the truth"*. This sets the stage for Part II's emotional conflict: Ellie struggles with the knowledge (or at least intuition) that Joel lied, which breeds resentment even as she loves him. It takes Ellie *"two years to even consider forgiving Joel,"* Gross notes, and just when she is ready to try, Joel is taken from her, *"escalating her challenge"*. Thus, the first game's end is both a powerful conclusion and the seed of the sequel's tragedy.

## **The Last of Us Part II (2038–2039)**, A Cycle of Vengeance and Redemption  

### Aftermath in Jackson (2034–2038)  
Joel and Ellie settled in Tommy's community in Jackson, Wyoming. **Jackson** proved to be the safe haven promised, a bustling town of survivors with fortified walls, electricity, schools for children, and even movies on the weekends. Joel and Ellie attempted to live a normal life, though the weight of the hospital incident lingered between them. Over the next four years, Joel became a respected member of the community (teaching patrol skills, singing and playing his guitar at gatherings), and Ellie grew from a teenager into a young adult amid peers her age. They forged new friendships: Ellie befriended a girl named **Dina** and a boy **Jesse** (among others her age in Jackson), and Joel kept close with Tommy and Maria while also acting as a surrogate father figure to others. 

However, Ellie could never fully shake her curiosity (and suspicion) about what really happened in Salt Lake City. **Two years after settling in Jackson (around 2036)**, Ellie's unease peaked. Despite Joel's claim that the Fireflies had "given up" on a cure, Ellie found that hard to accept. She traveled back to the **ruins of St. Mary's Hospital** on her own, seeking answers. Inside the dilapidated surgery wing, she discovered audio recordings and X-rays that strongly suggested she was indeed the only immune person and that a cure *could* have been made. Joel had no idea Ellie went back there. When Ellie returned to Jackson, she confronted Joel on his porch that night (this is shown via flashback in Part II). Cornered, **Joel finally confessed the truth**, that he killed everyone at the hospital and stopped the cure to save her. This revelation shattered Ellie. She told Joel she **"can't forgive him"** for taking away the meaning her life could have had, and furiously stated *"we're done."* From that point, Ellie **kept her distance from Joel**, speaking to him only when necessary. Joel, in turn, was deeply hurt by Ellie's rejection but remained patient, watching over her from afar. Both were heartbroken in their own way: Ellie felt betrayed that Joel robbed her of the chance to save others, and Joel felt the sting of losing the closeness they once shared. As Neil Druckmann explained, *"She loves him for what he's done for her, but she hates him for robbing her of that choice"*.

During this strained period (2036–2038), life in Jackson continued. Ellie threw herself into training (improving her shooting, going on patrols) and found solace in her friendship with **Dina**, who was warm, witty, and understanding. Dina and Ellie's bond eventually developed into a romantic relationship, though at first it was tentative. Dina had previously dated Jesse (another friend of Ellie's and the patrol leader's son), but they remained on good terms after breaking up. Jesse, Dina, and Ellie often hung out as a trio.

Joel, meanwhile, tried to reconnect with Ellie in small ways. On Ellie's **16th birthday (2035)**, Joel memorably took her to a **museum** full of dinosaurs and space exhibits. There, he surprised her with a recording of a rocket launch while she sat in a space capsule, catering to her fascination with astronomy. It was one of Ellie's happiest moments, temporarily melting her hardened exterior. (This flashback is one of the most beloved scenes in Part II, showing Joel's enduring fatherly love and Ellie's inner childlike joy.) **Ellie kept Joel's birthday gift, a photo of them from that day, even when she was angry at him**, indicating she still cared deeply.

By late **2037**, Abby's parallel story was unfolding afar: she and her ex-Firefly comrades had not forgotten Joel. Abby, now roughly 20 years old and a skilled member of the WLF (Washington Liberation Front) in Seattle, finally got a lead on Joel's location by interrogating former Fireflies (one likely being Joel's brother Tommy, whose name had surfaced). Abby and her group (which included Owen, Mel, Nora, Manny, Leah, and others, many of whom were at the hospital the day Joel took Ellie) decided to enact their long-delayed revenge. They knew Joel was in Jackson, Wyoming. They **traveled to Jackson in early 2038**, planning to draw Joel out and kill him. 

In **March 2038**, events came to a head. Jackson was thriving, that winter they even held a communal dance. At the **winter dance**, Ellie and Dina shared a romantic kiss on the dance floor for the first time publicly. A tipsy old bigot named **Seth** insulted them for it; Joel, ever protective, intervened and pushed Seth off, causing a scene. Ellie, still resentful of Joel (and embarrassed), yelled at Joel to leave her alone in front of everyone. It was an ugly moment that both regretted. That same night, after cooling off, **Ellie went to Joel's house to confront him about the truth once more** (this is shown in a late Part II flashback). She told him that she doesn't think she can ever forgive him for what he did at the hospital, *"but I'd like to try."* Joel was emotional and told her *"I'd do it all over again,"* reaffirming his choice. Ellie's last words to him that night were that she would try to forgive. This was a crucial step, Ellie was willing to attempt reconciliation. Tragically, **this conversation happened just hours before Joel's death**, meaning Ellie never got the chance to fully mend things.

### The Murder of Joel (March 2038)  
The next morning, **March 2, 2038**, a patrol schedule brought all our characters into play. Jackson ran regular perimeter patrols to clear out infected. Joel and Tommy went out early to check an area beyond the usual rotation (Maria had gotten word of a large horde nearby). Separately, Ellie and Dina set out on their own patrol route (Jesse, who is now a patrol leader, assigned them to check the west Jackson outskirts). Jesse himself was scheduled to rendezvous with Joel and Tommy later at a local ski lodge.

Meanwhile, Abby's group had reached the vicinity of Jackson. They found an old **snowed-in lodge (the Baldwin mansion)** to hide in. Abby, impatient and obsessed, set out *alone* in the pre-dawn to scout Jackson's perimeter, hoping to find Joel. (Her group was uneasy about attacking a whole community; Owen in particular told Abby it's suicide to assault Jackson head-on.) Abby ended up in peril: she encountered part of the horde moving through the area and became trapped, fleeing through a blizzard.

By chance, Joel and Tommy crossed paths with Abby when they rescued her from a swarm of infected coming over a ridge. Not knowing who she was (and Abby concealing her recognition of **Joel's name** when Tommy introduced them), Joel and Tommy followed Abby to her safehouse, the mansion where the rest of Abby's group waited. Joel even altruistically saved Abby during the escape, solidifying her acting as a helpless stranger.

Inside the lodge, Abby's friends were shocked when **Joel "Miller" introduced himself**, this was their target delivered to their doorstep. In a chilling turn, **Abby's crew surrounded Joel and Tommy at gunpoint**. Joel realized too late that something was very wrong; he even muttered that *"you've heard of us"* given the hostile stares. Without hesitation, Abby **shot Joel's leg** with a shotgun, shattering his knee and immobilizing him. Tommy was beaten unconscious and tied up. Ellie (and others) were still unaware and out in the storm.

Back in Jackson, **Ellie and Dina** got caught in the blizzard and took shelter in an old library (where Dina confessed she was falling in love with Ellie, and Ellie shared more of her past). **Jesse**, worried that Joel and Tommy hadn't shown up at the ski lodge, left to find Ellie and Dina, then told Ellie that Joel was missing. Elllie's heart sank; she immediately raced off alone toward the last area Joel was supposed to be patrolling. Through winds and snow she came upon the mansion (drawn by the sound of gunfire maybe or just luck).

Inside the mansion's basement, Ellie found a scene of horror: **Joel was on the floor, gravely wounded**, one leg mangled, **Abby and her comrades standing around him**. They had tortured him for a bit (Abby was venting years of hatred). Ellie screamed and tried to rush to Joel, but was overpowered, held down by Owen and Mel. Joel, bloody and barely conscious, managed to lift his head at Ellie's voice. Ellie cried and begged them to stop. **In a single, devastating blow, Abby brought a golf club down on Joel's skull**, **killing him** in front of Ellie. Tommy, already incapacitated, and Ellie were spared immediate execution, Owen argued against killing them, feeling it was needless now that Joel was dead. Abby, staring coldly at a sobbing, devastated Ellie, decided to leave them alive, ominously saying *"We gave you your chance."* The group left Ellie with Joel's destroyed corpse. Ellie crawled to Joel, shaking with grief. 

This is the inciting tragedy of Part II. **Ellie's world shattered**: Joel, the man who became her father figure, is gone in an unimaginably brutal way, and she couldn't stop it. Moreover, her last interaction with Joel was complicated by resentment and an *unfulfilled promise of forgiveness*. This guilt compounds her sorrow into something darker: **a burning desire for vengeance**. Druckmann and Gross have noted that Part II's story is about the **"cycle of violence"** born from such trauma. Ellie's ego and sense of justice become intertwined, she believes she cannot rest until she "makes it right". Indeed, Druckmann explicitly contrasted Joel and Ellie here: Joel's violence was pragmatic, **"indifferent"**, but Ellie's is fueled by deeply personal hatred and the need to avenge a wrong.

### Seattle, Ellie's Quest for Revenge (June 2038)  
In the weeks following Joel's murder, Ellie is a wreck of grief and rage. She buries Joel in Jackson. One of Abby's friends (**Nick**) was captured by Tommy during the chaos and revealed under interrogation that Abby and her crew came from **Seattle**, and most were ex-Fireflies now with the **Washington Liberation Front (WLF)**. **Tommy**, equally devastated (Joel was his brother), initially argues against chasing them, it's  a long, perilous journey and Jackson needs its protectors. But secretly, Tommy **leaves Jackson on his own**, heading to Seattle to exact revenge. When Ellie learns Tommy has gone, she insists **she must go after Abby** too. Maria reluctantly lets Ellie go (after Dina insists on accompanying Ellie so she won't be alone). **Ellie, Dina, and Jesse** had all been formidable fighters on patrol; Maria knows she can't really stop them. She asks only that they bring Tommy back if possible.

Thus, Ellie and Dina set out for Seattle, roughly in June 2038. (Ellie is 19 now.) The trip takes about two weeks on horseback. **Seattle** in 2038 is a war zone. Years earlier, the WLF (a militia of former FEDRA soldiers and locals) **overthrew FEDRA's Seattle Quarantine Zone** and established control over the city. Their authoritarian rule is opposed by the religious Seraphites who dominate the outskirts and an island nearby. By 2038, the **WLF ("Wolves")** and **Seraphites ("Scars")** are locked in a vicious stalemate, routinely killing each other. The WLF are well-armed (based in a fortified stadium), while the Seraphites are stealthy and lethal with bows, using the cover of overgrown nature. Seattle's environment is lush with moss and rain; shamblers (new infected) roam the flooded areas. Amidst this, Ellie and Dina arrive with their own mission.

**Seattle Day 1:** Ellie and Dina enter Seattle through the ruined highway and quickly encounter signs of WLF presence (propaganda, checkpoints). In downtown Seattle's open area, they find a **WLF checkpoint gate** and **get proof of Abby's involvement**: a checkpoint list and a **map** that indicate the WLF was expecting a group from Jackson around this time. They deduce Abby indeed is WLF. They also find evidence of FEDRA's brutal end here (mass graves of "traitors" executed, per documents, showing the WLF revolution was bloody). Ellie and Dina's immediate goal is to find any lead on Abby's location. Over Day 1, they scavenge for gasoline to open gates, and explore downtown. They stumble on a **WLF safe house** in a TV station where they find a dead body of **Leah**, one of Abby's friends (she was already killed by Tommy, who had been busy in the city ahead of them). Leah's belongings include **photos of Abby's group** and their names, confirming to Ellie exactly who was involved. Ellie pockets a photo of **Owen** with "Owen" written on it, suspecting he's next target. They also learn some WLF slang (calling themselves "Wolves" and calling Seraphites "Scars").

While escaping the TV station (after being pursued by a WLF squad alerted by all the commotion), Dina falls ill, revealing she's **pregnant** (with Jesse's child). They take shelter at an old theater to rest. This news worries Ellie but she remains determined to continue. Dina will stay at the theater base due to her condition. 

That night, **Jesse** suddenly arrives, having trailed them from Jackson. Now the trio is reunited in the theater hideout. Tommy is also somewhere in the city, doing his own vendetta (they've seen his handiwork: a sniper who killed some WLF, which was Tommy).

**Seattle Day 2:** Ellie insists on going out to hunt the next target (she got intel that **Nora**, one of Abby's friends who was at Jackson, is at the WLF hospital). Jesse wants to find Tommy instead. They split up: Jesse secretly follows Ellie at first (thinking she's chasing Tommy) and saves her from Seraphites in Hillcrest. But Ellie tricks Jesse into going back to Dina at the theater, while she heads alone to the hospital for Nora.

Reaching **Seattle WLF hospital**, Ellie confronts **Nora** in the spore-infested basement. Immune and furious, Ellie corners Nora, who refuses to give up Abby's location, taunting Ellie about Joel's death: *"He got what he deserved."* In a violent interrogation, Ellie **beats Nora to death with a pipe** after extracting that **Abby is hiding at the Aquarium**. The encounter leaves Ellie shaken to her core, it's the first time she's brutally tortured someone. She staggers back to the theater, where she breaks down in Dina's arms, confessing *"I made her talk…."*. We see Ellie's psyche deteriorating: each act of violence is weighing on her, yet she pushes on, believing vengeance will bring closure.

**Seattle Day 3:** With Nora's info, Ellie knows Abby is likely at the Seattle Aquarium (Aquarium is where Owen, Abby's ex, works as a safe house). Despite Tommy's proximity (they hear on a WLF radio that a sniper, Tommy, is at the marina), Ellie chooses to go to the Aquarium to catch Abby before she flees. **Jesse** accompanies Ellie at first, but when they get a clue of Tommy's location (gunshots and radio calls from the marina), Jesse veers off to help Tommy, urging Ellie to come. Ellie refuses; *"Abby's at the aquarium,"* she insists. Jesse, frustrated, goes to rescue Tommy alone. This decision isolates Ellie further.

Ellie infiltrates the Aquarium, finding **Owen** and **Mel** (Abby's friends). In a tense confrontation, a panicked **Ellie ends up shooting Owen** and in the scuffle **stabs Mel**, only after does she realize Mel was pregnant. This horrifies Ellie. Now Ellie is traumatized not only by witnessing Joel's death, but by the atrocities she herself has committed. She retrieves from Owen's dying words that **Abby is on the "Salt Lake crew"** and that Abby might be at a **nearby Seraphite island** (Owen was planning to escape there). Ellie then stumbles out, numb, returning to the theater. There, she finds that **Tommy and Jesse have made it back**. But immediately, **Abby** ambushes them at the theater: Abby tracked them via the map Ellie left at the Aquarium. Abby shoots **Jesse** in the face, killing him instantly, and holds Tommy at gunpoint, blowing out his knee and knocking him unconscious. The scene ends with Abby snarling **"You killed my friends. We let you live and you wasted it."**, mirroring what she told Ellie the night of Joel's death. 

At this cliffhanger, the perspective **shifts to Abby's side of the story**. The game rewinds to **Seattle Day 1 from Abby's perspective**, allowing the player to finally understand the other side. We learn Abby's backstory: her father was the surgeon Joel killed. Abby's grief and rage over her dad's murder drove her to obsessively train (explaining her muscular physique) and to find Joel. After killing Joel, Abby felt some closure but not peace, she suffered PTSD and nightmares of the hospital and of **children crying** (a memory of finding her father and others dead). Over the three Seattle days, Abby goes through her own transformative journey, separate from Ellie's. 

**Abby Day 1:** Abby, back with the WLF, is initially just going through the motions after Joel's death. She's assigned to a mission at the Forward Operating Base. Through Abby's eyes, we see the WLF's operations and meet their leader **Isaac**, who is preparing a final assault to wipe out the Seraphites. Abby's closest friends in WLF are **Manny** (a sharpshooter) and **Mel** (a medic, Owen's girlfriend, and visibly pregnant), though Abby and Mel's relationship is strained. Abby discovers **Owen** (her ex-boyfriend) went AWOL after a mission in which he accidentally killed a **WLF elder** (whom Abby learns was trying to defect to the Fireflies). Isaac brands Owen a traitor. Concerned for Owen, Abby sneaks out to search for him at the Aquarium (their hideout spot). 

On the way, Abby is captured by Seraphites and nearly executed, this is where she meets **Yara** and **Lev**, Seraphite siblings who were being punished by their own people (Lev had broken a religious rule by cutting his hair, revealing he's transgender, considered an apostate). Abby sees **Lev** (a 13-year-old boy) and Yara (16) as they're tied up. In an intense scene, the Seraphites **hammer-break Yara's arm** and attempt to hang Abby. **Lev saves Abby** by shooting the Seraphite with an arrow, and a chaotic fight ensues with infected that swarm the area. Abby ends up **saving both Yara and Lev** from Infected, fleeing with them into the night. She then leaves the injured siblings in a safe trailer, uncertain if she should care for them further.

Abby reaches the Aquarium and reunites with **Owen**. Owen is distraught with WLF life and the constant war; he reveals he accidentally killed a fellow WLF (the defector) and is done with the fight. He plans to sail to Santa Barbara where he *heard the Fireflies are regrouping*. Abby is upset, both with him abandoning the cause and because he's with Mel now, but she still harbors love for him. That night, Abby can't sleep, she's haunted by dreams of the **slain children in the hospital** (perhaps symbolic of Lev and Yara now). Feeling guilt for leaving the siblings, Abby returns at **daybreak of Day 2** to where she left Yara and Lev.

**Abby Day 2:** Abby finds Yara and Lev and brings them to the Aquarium, where Mel, despite personal friction, performs emergency surgery to amputate Yara's shattered arm (this parallel of selfless medical care echoes how Joel's selfish act killed Abby's father, a doctor). The surgery requires supplies, leading to **Abby and Lev bonding on a quest** to the downtown **WLF hospital** to retrieve surgical kit and antibiotics. During this trek, Lev opens up about **being trans** (born "Lily" but never fitting their female role; he shaved his head to be like the male Seraphite soldiers, which is why they hunted him). Abby becomes protective of Lev, admiring his courage. In the hospital basement, Abby faces her greatest fear, the origin of the infection in Seattle, a zone quarantined since outbreak day. Here, Abby battles the grotesque **"Rat King"**, a giant amalgam of infected that has lurked for 25 years. She narrowly defeats it, showcasing her resilience. This monstrous fight is symbolic: Abby is literally confronting the heart of the infection that caused all this misery. She returns with the supplies, saving Yara.

**Abby Day 3:** Abby awakens to find Lev missing. Lev, in a quest for closure, stole a boat to return to the **Seraphite island** to convince his mother to leave the cult with him. Abby and Yara, fearing the worst, pursue Lev onto the island just as the **WLF launches its all-out attack** on the Seraphites. Navigating the war-torn burning village, Abby finds Lev in his former home: sadly, Lev was forced to kill his mother in self-defense (she reacted violently to Lev's transition). Yara and Abby comfort the devastated Lev, but at that moment the WLF forces (led by Isaac) catch them. Isaac, seeing Abby fraternizing with Seraphites, threatens to execute Lev. **Yara sacrifices herself**, she shoots Isaac to protect Lev and is gunned down by WLF soldiers. Abby and Lev manage to escape as the island goes up in flames, with WLF and Seraphites slaughtering each other around them. It's a harrowing sequence underscoring the senseless violence of war, a microcosm of the cycle of revenge theme on a larger scale.

Abby and Lev reach the Aquarium by nighttime on Day 3, only to find Owen and Mel **dead** (killed by Ellie). Abby is shattered by the loss of her friends. Lev finds **Ellie's map** that marked the theater as their hideout. Abby, in a rage, **heads to the theater for vengeance**, leading to the confrontation that ended Day 3.

Now, **Abby stands in the theater** over Ellie and Dina. At this point, the player has come to empathize with Abby, we've seen her save lives and show mercy (she let the siblings live, risked herself to help them) while Ellie's path showed her becoming what she feared. The stage is set for a tragic collision.

### The Theater Confrontation (End of Seattle)  
Back in the theater scene (the timeline converges), **Abby has just killed Jesse and overpowered Tommy**, then fought Ellie. In a vicious brawl, Abby gains the upper hand and is about to kill **Dina** (who tried to intervene). Ellie screams that Dina is pregnant, hoping to dissuade Abby. Abby coldly says *"Good."* and moves to slit Dina's throat, intending to repay Ellie's group in kind for Mel. **Lev** steps in, yelling *"Abby, no!"* This stops Abby from going through with it. Panting with fury, **Abby decides to spare Ellie and Dina**, albeit with a harsh warning: *"Don't ever let me see you again."* Abby and Lev then leave. The cycle of violence could end here, but its consequences remain: Ellie's revenge quest has left her traumatized, and she's lost friends (Jesse, and nearly Tommy who is badly injured).

The remainder of the story serves as an epilogue showing the aftermath and one final confrontation born of unresolved guilt. **Ellie and Dina, shaken** but alive, return to Jackson with Tommy. **Several months later**, Dina gives birth to her baby (JJ) and she and Ellie live on a farm beyond Jackson. Initially, it seems they might find peace: Ellie tries to be a good partner and co-parent, and Dina is happy to leave the violence behind. But Ellie suffers from **severe PTSD**, she has flashbacks of Joel's death, waking up screaming at night. She cannot play Joel's guitar without recalling her missing fingers on chords (or later when she loses fingers). Ellie is **haunted by guilt**: not only Joel's violent end, but also the fact she never got to fully reconcile with him. One evening, Tommy (permanently disabled and bitter, as Maria left him) visits and shares intel that **Abby and Lev were spotted in Santa Barbara**, supposedly captured by a slave gang called the **Rattlers**. Tommy, unable to go himself, pressures Ellie to finish it. Dina argues fiercely against this, they have a life, a baby, and Abby spared them. **Ellie initially refuses to go**, but her PTSD and survivor's guilt gnaw at her. 

Late that night, Ellie decides she cannot let Abby live, in her mind, Joel's memory demands it, and perhaps she thinks this will quell her nightmares. Dina begs her to stay, giving an ultimatum: if Ellie leaves, **Dina won't be here when she returns**. Heartbroken but driven, **Ellie departs for Santa Barbara** to pursue Abby one last time, effectively sacrificing her relationship and new family for this obsession.

### Santa Barbara (Late 2038 into 2039)  
In Santa Barbara, Abby and Lev, after leaving Ellie alive, actually sought out the Fireflies. They managed to contact a Firefly base on Catalina Island via radio. Hopeful, they left to meet them, but fell into a trap by the **Rattlers**, a surviving group of slavers who capture travelers and use them for labor or bait for infected. **Abby and Lev were enslaved**: by the time Ellie arrives (a couple months later, spring 2039), Abby and Lev have tried to escape once and as punishment, Abby was tied to a post outdoors to suffer for several days (emaciated and near-death). 

**Ellie** makes her way through the Rattlers' beachfront compound, brutally dispatching many Rattlers (in a mirror of Joel's hospital rampage). Notably, she even tortures one for info by letting an infected bite him, showing how far she's fallen in methods. She frees some other slaves (showing Ellie can still do good, albeit her goal is singular). Finally, Ellie **finds Abby and Lev** strung up on wooden pillars by the beach. Abby is so malnourished her muscle mass is gone; she's a shadow of her former self, hair crudely cut, spirit seemingly broken. Ellie cuts them down, in that moment seemingly just to *find* Abby, not necessarily help. Abby, carrying an unconscious Lev to a rowboat, quietly tells Ellie "there are boats this way." Abby has no fight left in her; she only cares about saving Lev. 

On the water's edge, as Abby places Lev in a boat, **Ellie still cannot let go**. With tears in her eyes, she draws her knife and forces Abby to fight her, threatening to kill Lev if Abby won't engage. Abby, exhausted, reluctantly fights. **Their final fight** is savage and desperate, both women badly wounded, grappling in knee-high surf under a grey sky. Ellie is blinded by vengeance and nearly drowns Abby, pushing her under. In that moment, **Ellie gets a flash of Joel**, not the bloody dying Joel, but Joel sitting on his porch, guitar in hand, looking at her with kindness. This memory triggers something in Ellie: she **finally lets Abby go**, pulling her up from the water. Choking back sobs, Ellie tells Abby and Lev to leave. Abby, stunned but not wasting the chance, helps Lev into a boat. Before departing, Abby looks at Ellie with a mixture of gratitude and pity. She and Lev motor away into the fog toward Catalina, toward the hope of the Fireflies, bringing Abby's arc to a close as she seeks a new purpose beyond revenge.

Ellie is left alone on the shore, physically and emotionally shattered. She lost two fingers in the fight (bitten off by Abby when Ellie tried to push her under). Dripping wet and bleeding, Ellie slowly makes her way back to the empty farmhouse where Dina and the baby were. As Dina warned, the house is vacant, belongings gone. All that remains is Joel's guitar in Ellie's room. In a poignant final scene, Ellie tries to play **Joel's song ("Future Days") on the guitar**, but with two fingers missing, she can't form the chords properly. The guitar, symbol of her bond with Joel, now yields a broken melody. Ellie sets it down. She recalls at last her *final conversation with Joel*, revealed in a flashback: the night before his death, Ellie told Joel she was *"ready to try to forgive [him]"* for the lie, and Joel tearfully responded, *"I'd like that."*. This memory is crucial: it reframes Ellie's entire vendetta. She wasn't just angry Joel died; she was angry at herself for not forgiving him before he was taken. **In this realization, Ellie finally finds a measure of peace**, not through killing Abby (she spared her), but through forgiving Joel and herself. With Joel's voice echoing in her mind ("*I'd do it all over again*" regarding saving her), Ellie understands the depth of his love and that her life really did mean something to him. 

Ellie leaves the guitar behind, symbolizing letting go of Joel's ghost, though it's heartbreaking for her, and walks off into the unknown, two fingers short, alone. The ending is intentionally ambiguous and somber. Ellie has **lost almost everything** (Joel, Jesse, possibly Dina, her innocence, even part of her ability to play guitar). But by **choosing mercy over revenge at the last moment**, she preserved a shred of her soul and honored Joel's memory not by avenging his death, but by valuing the love he gave her. As Halley Gross puts it, *"Ellie's path to forgiving Abby is by far a much harder journey… Right when she says ‘OK, I'm ready to try to forgive Joel,' it's like, no, your challenge escalates to something that could destroy you and those you love… and are you going to be able to get there in time?"*. Ellie *almost* didn't, but at the final moment, she did. 

The story of _The Last of Us_ thus comes full circle in a twisted way: a tale that began with Joel saving Ellie at all costs ends with Ellie saving Abby (and Lev) by letting go of vengeance. It underlines the series' core themes: **the cyclic nature of violence, the enduring power (and burden) of love, and the possibility of forgiveness**.

## Major Character Arcs and Development

- **Joel Miller:** Introduced as a hardened survivor who lost his daughter Sarah in the outbreak, Joel's journey is one of rediscovering his capacity for love. In **Part I**, escorting Ellie gradually transforms Joel, from a detached, survival-at-all-costs smuggler to a caring father figure willing to sacrifice the world for this one girl. His decision to save Ellie from the Fireflies (dooming a potential cure) is controversial but deeply human, driven by love and fear of loss. In **Part II**, Joel enjoys a few years of happiness in Jackson (playing guitar, bonding with Ellie as family) before facing retribution for his past. Joel's death at Abby's hands is the linchpin for the entire revenge saga. Even after death, Joel's influence endures in Ellie's psyche: her trauma, her longing for justice, and ultimately her memory of Joel's **mercy and love** guide her away from becoming a "monster" herself. Notably, Joel's last act was **telling Ellie the truth** (finally) and accepting that it might cost their relationship. In a flashback just before his death, he asserts he would **"do it all over again"**, a stance that encapsulates Joel's arc: he unwaveringly chose personal love over humanity's abstract hope. Developer insight emphasizes that Joel doesn't regret saving Ellie, even if it led to his demise. Joel's arc shows the **extremes of parental love**, both its beauty and its dark consequences.

- **Ellie Williams:** We meet Ellie as a witty, brave 14-year-old who is immune to Cordyceps, giving her a burdensome hope-of-mankind destiny. Over **Part I**, Ellie evolves from a cargo/mission objective into Joel's surrogate daughter and a capable survivor in her own right. She experiences horrific losses (Riley, Tess, Sam, etc.) yet retains a core of empathy and humor. Ellie's immunity and the question of sacrificing herself for a cure is a central moral dilemma. Joel's lie to her at the end of Part I freezes that conflict, **Ellie suspects the lie** and it erodes her trust. By **Part II**, at 19, Ellie is a hardened young woman grappling with trauma and bitterness. Joel's murder is a breaking point that sends her down a dark path of revenge. Her arc in Part II is arguably a **tragedy of obsession**: she becomes increasingly ruthless, killing many (including Mel, a pregnant woman, which horrifies Ellie when she realizes it). Her single-minded pursuit costs her Jesse, strains her relationship with Dina, and nearly costs her own life and soul. Yet, at her darkest moment, Ellie **chooses to break the cycle**: she spares Abby, prompted by a loving memory of Joel. This decision is Ellie's pivotal growth, a step toward forgiving Joel (and herself) and reclaiming some humanity. By the end, Ellie has lost her innocence and even the ability to play Joel's guitar, symbolizing the heavy price of her vengeance. But she finally finds a measure of **acceptance**: her final whisper of "Okay" to Joel's earlier plea symbolizes her attempt to let go of hate and hold onto the love she had. As Neil Druckmann noted, Ellie's ego and identity got entwined with righting the wrong done to Joel ("a **‘culture of honor'** mindset"), but ultimately it's letting go of that honor-bound revenge that gives her a chance to heal.

- **Abby Anderson:** Introduced in Part II as Joel's killer and perceived antagonist, Abby's arc is a foil to Ellie's. As a teen, Abby was kind and idealistic (we see her gently talk a **zebra** free in a flashback, showing her empathy). Joel's killing of her father Jerry (the Firefly surgeon) shattered her. Over four years, Abby transformed her body and numbed her emotions, living only for revenge. When she finally kills Joel, it doesn't bring the solace she expected, instead, she is left with nightmares and a hollow victory. Across the three days in Seattle, Abby undergoes a **redemptive journey**: she saves and bonds with Lev (and Yara), which reawakens her compassion and sense of purpose beyond vengeance. By protecting Lev, effectively becoming an older sister or guardian, Abby finds someone who **needs her**, filling the void left by her father's loss. Her decision to spare Ellie and Dina at the theater is significant: Abby breaks the cycle on her end, perhaps realizing that killing Ellie, a **"little bitch"** as Abby had angrily called her, won't bring her peace (Lev's presence is key in stopping her rage). By the end, Abby's priorities shift entirely to **Lev and finding the Fireflies**, signifying hope and rebuilding. She endures torture by the Rattlers and still musters the strength to carry Lev to safety. Abby's final act is sailing toward the Firefly sanctuary, a chance at a new life defined not by hate but by the cause her father believed in (saving people). In developer commentary, it's pointed out that Abby's arc was about **finding closure and then purpose**: after avenging her dad, she "struggles to come to grips with it" until Lev gives her a new reason to live. Abby thus goes from an antagonist in players' eyes to a protagonist with a genuine redemption, highlighting the game's theme that **everyone is the hero of their own story**, and cycles of violence can be broken with empathy (the player, as Abby, even empathizes with a **Clicker-infested dog** in a dream, reflecting her subconscious guilt and compassion returning).

- **Tommy Miller:** Joel's younger brother, Tommy has an interesting arc from idealist to embittered survivor. In early years, Tommy joined the Fireflies, seeking to restore order and hope. By Part I, he found peace in Jackson with Maria, distancing himself from Joel's ruthless methods. However, Joel's death triggers Tommy's old violent streak: he independently goes on a revenge quest, showing a capacity for brutality (he sniped dozens of WLF and tortured at least one for info). Unlike Ellie, Tommy doesn't reach closure, he is physically crippled by Abby (shot in the eye) and emotionally shattered by failure. By the farm epilogue, Tommy is bitter, **"broken up inside"**: he pressures Ellie to continue the vendetta he can't carry out. Tragically, Tommy loses everything: his marriage to Maria is implied to have fallen apart, and after Ellie refuses at first to go after Abby, he spitefully remarks on Joel's death as if to guilt her, showing how resentment consumed his gentle nature. Tommy's arc is perhaps the most tragic: he survived so much only to end up alone, defined by loss and anger, a cautionary mirror of what Ellie could become. In the end, Tommy does not get the revenge he wanted, but Abby sparing him (and Ellie later sparing Abby) shows that mercy came from the very cycle he perpetuated, even if Tommy himself couldn't break free of it.

- **Dina:** A Jackson resident and Ellie's girlfriend, Dina's arc is relatively stable, she serves as Ellie's anchor to humanity and normal life. Loving, funny, and resourceful, Dina proves her devotion by accompanying Ellie to Seattle and caring for her through trauma. When Dina discovers she's pregnant with Jesse's child, she fears it might burden Ellie, but Ellie remains supportive. Dina saves Ellie's life multiple times (e.g., during the sniper Tommy encounter). Ultimately, Dina represents **the possibility of a peaceful life**, on the farm, she and Ellie share tender moments raising baby JJ. However, Dina has her limits: having lost Jesse and nearly Ellie, she prioritizes their child's wellbeing. Her giving Ellie an ultimatum shows her strength, she won't indulge Ellie's self-destructive revenge further. By leaving the farm when Ellie goes, Dina stands by her word. She likely returns to Jackson to raise JJ, possibly with support from Maria. Dina's development is subtle: initially she's adventurous and eager to help Ellie, but by the end she's disillusioned by the toll of vengeance and chooses family over violence. Dina's last known status is unresolved in the game, but we know she tried her best to save Ellie from herself. In a sense, Dina's arc is incomplete (we assume she's heartbroken Ellie chose revenge over their family), but her character remains one of the few unequivocally positive influences. She gave Ellie a glimpse of a life worth living (*"**There are still good people and things worth fighting for**,"* Dina might say with her actions). Unfortunately, Ellie wasn't ready to accept that fully until it was too late. 

- **Lev (and Yara):** Lev and Yara highlight the theme of innocence amid fanaticism. As Seraphites, they were raised in a rigid religion. Lev's identity as a trans boy (born "Lily") put him at odds with their traditions, demonstrating the cult's intolerance. Lev's arc is about **self-realization and bravery**: he breaks from his people, at great personal cost (causing Yara's arm injury and ultimately Yara's death and having to kill his own mother in self-defense). Through Abby's protection, Lev learns that **outsiders can be kind**, reshaping his worldview. By Part II's end, Lev becomes Abby's surrogate family, the two ex-Fireflies and ex-Seraphites embark to find the Fireflies. Lev remains stoic but clearly trusts Abby completely (e.g., stopping her from killing Dina). Lev's presence is vital: he effectively *saves* Abby morally, and even saves Ellie (by stopping Abby in the theater). If Ellie's immunity symbolized hope for a cure, Lev's survival symbolizes hope for **breaking social and ideological barriers**. Yara, likewise, showed immense courage, she sacrificed herself to allow Lev to live and Abby to escape. Yara's arc is short but impactful: once a devout Seraphite, she chose her brother's life over dogma, cooperating with outsiders (Abby) and paying the ultimate price for her sibling love. Lev carries Yara's memory forward. In a way, Lev and Abby become for each other what Joel and Ellie were in the first game: two individuals from vastly different backgrounds who form a **new family** in the wasteland. 

- **Marlene:** The Firefly leader appears in Part I and via flashbacks in Part II. Marlene's arc is about **duty vs. personal attachment**. As Ellie's guardian (due to her friendship with Ellie's mother, Anna), Marlene struggled with the decision to sacrifice Ellie for the cure. Recordings show she agonized and even begged Joel to understand *"It's what Ellie would want"*. In the end, Marlene prioritized the hope of humanity, but that decision cost her life, Joel killed her to protect Ellie. Interestingly, Marlene in a flashback tells Abby's dad *"If it were your daughter, would you do it?"* indicating Marlene knew how painful it was. Marlene embodies the **firefly cause**: noble in intent, but ruthless in execution. Neil Druckmann has noted that Marlene *"cares for Ellie, but she has to consider the bigger picture."* Her death is the end of the Fireflies as they were, they disband after losing both Marlene and Jerry. Marlene's legacy lives on in Abby (who eventually seeks the reformed Fireflies) and in Ellie (whose survivor's guilt partly stems from knowing Marlene died trying to do what Ellie sees as the right thing). Marlene's arc is ultimately tragic duty: she *almost* did what was necessary for a cure, but **Joel's love for Ellie** thwarted her, showing the story's central conflict between **love and the greater good** from another angle.

- **Supporting characters (Henry & Sam, Bill & Frank, Jesse, Owen & Mel, etc.):** Each supporting character's mini-arc reinforces themes of **love, loss, and moral ambiguity** in the world. **Henry and Sam** in Part I illustrate how quickly hope can crumble: Henry's entire purpose was protecting Sam, but after Sam's infection, Henry in despair says *"What have I done?"* and ends his life. Their fate deeply affects Ellie (fueling her fear of ending up alone). **Bill and Frank** show a contrast: Bill's fear-driven isolation cost him Frank's companionship, Frank chose death over living with Bill. Bill survives, but his last words to Joel are bitter advice *"Trusting people will get you killed"*, a lesson Joel later unlearns thanks to Ellie. **Jesse** serves as a grounded, loyal friend who is collateral damage in Ellie's vendetta, his death exemplifies the innocent lives lost in cycles of violence (Jesse was a genuinely good guy, excited to be a father, but he died abruptly, underscoring the cruelty of revenge outcomes). **Owen** is an interesting case: a former Firefly turned WLF who became disillusioned by endless killing, he represents the **hope to find something better** (the Firefly regroup), but he's killed by Ellie while trying to protect pregnant Mel. Owen's idealism (wanting to spare a Seraphite girl earlier, which caused his falling out with Isaac) ironically mirrors Ellie's idealism in Part I about a cure, and his death is one more casualty in the Ellie-Abby feud. **Mel**, a kind medic, is arguably one of the most innocent: her death at Ellie's hands, and Ellie's horror upon realizing Mel was pregnant, is a low point for Ellie's morality, it's the point where Ellie questions herself (*"I'm not a bad person"* she says shakily, hoping for Dina's reassurance). This propels Ellie further down self-loathing. **Manny** (Abby's friend) is a lighter character (joking, talking about movies); he too dies suddenly (sniped by Tommy) with no final profound moment, highlighting how violent conflict spares no one, not even the charismatic and seemingly safe. Each of these characters adds a thread to the tapestry of the narrative: love for family (Henry/Sam, Owen/Mel, Jesse/Dina), the quest for meaning (Owen's Firefly search, Henry's hope for a safe haven), the cost of survival (Bill/Frank, Manny), and they all in their own ways motivate or influence the main characters' decisions.

In sum, _The Last of Us_ universe is driven by its characters' arcs, **Joel and Ellie's bond** built on love but tested by moral dilemmas, **Abby and Lev's bond** built from empathy rising out of hate, and a supporting cast that illustrates the spectrum of humanity in chaos. By the end of Part II, every major character has been indelibly shaped by the events: **Ellie** is left scarred and uncertain but potentially wiser, **Abby** finds a hopeful path with Lev, **Tommy** lives on bitterly, and **Dina** presumably returns to Jackson to raise JJ, possibly waiting to see if Ellie ever heals her inner wounds and comes home. The game ends on a subdued note, with Ellie walking away from the farm toward the woods, a metaphor for an uncertain future, yet the **cycle of violence has finally been broken**. Ellie chose Joel's way (love/mercy) at the last second over continued hate, suggesting that while she paid a terrible price, there might still be hope for her to find **purpose and peace**, as Joel and Abby did in their own ways.

## Infected Stages & Enemy Types (In-Game Lore)

The Cordyceps Brain Infection has several stages of infected humans, each with distinct behavior and lore. Over 25 years, the games show how the fungus adapts within hosts to create increasingly dangerous creatures. The table below summarizes each **infected stage** and key characteristics:

| **Infected Type**     | **Appearance & Stage**           | **Description & Behavior**                                                                             | **Notable Lore**                                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Runner** (Stage 1)  | Recently infected (within 1-2 days); human-like appearance with bloodied eyes and veins. | **Fast, aggressive swarmers:** Retain much of human mobility. They sprint at victims, wildly flailing and swiping. Runners still vocalize screams or pleas, hinting at residual humanity. They are the **most common** infected and often the first stage seen in outbreaks. Individually weak, but dangerous in numbers. | *Lore:* Many early outbreak victims became Runners. Sarah (Joel's daughter) was killed by a soldier to prevent turning, showing how feared this stage was. In Boston QZ, FEDRA would publicly execute newly bitten people to stop runners from emerging. Joel and Tess mention that infected turn "within two days" in most cases. |
| **Stalker** (Stage 2) | Infected for **2 weeks to a month**; begin developing fungal growths on head/face but eyes often still visible. | **Stealthy and cunning:** Stalkers balance aggression with caution. They hide and ambush when possible, often seen sneaking along walls. They make croaking or hissing noises. The fungus is starting to alter their visage, causing erratic movements. | *Lore:* The first Stalkers likely appeared a few weeks after outbreak, by late 2013 reports mention "stage 2 infected". In-game, stalkers are encountered sparingly (e.g., basement of the hotel in Pittsburgh). They embody the infection's growing hold; an in-game journal from a survivor describes hearing someone he knew "lurking in the shadows, not fully a Clicker yet," likely referring to a stalker. |
| **Clicker** (Stage 3)  | Infected for **1+ year**; face fully overgrown by fungus, rendering them **blind**. Crusted fruiting bodies protrude from the skull like a cracked mushroom. | **Echolocation hunters:** Clickers emit distinctive clicking sounds to "see" via echolocation (hence their name). They are extremely aggressive and strong. A Clicker's bite is an instant death for victims (game mechanics reflect this). Their fungal plates act as armor, so they can absorb gunshots. They move in jerky, erratic motions but can be eerily still when listening for prey. | *Lore:* Clickers are iconic in TLoU world. Ellie's joke book quips aside, they inspire terror in survivors. In Boston's museum, Joel whispers **"Clickers, don't make a sound"**, indicating how well-known and feared they are. FEDRA documents note that about a year post-outbreak, the first Clickers emerged. Some collectibles (e.g., a Firefly map) mark Clicker hotspots. Their echolocation is so developed that survivors learn to hide or distract using sound (bottles, etc.). Physically, the fungal plates on a Clicker's head can sometimes be pried open to reveal vestiges of the human face beneath, reinforcing the tragedy that these were once people. |
| **Bloater** (Stage 4)  | Infected for **many years** (est. 10+ years). Enormous, bloated body covered in thick, armored fungal plates. Fungal pustules visible. | **Tank-like brutes:** Bloaters are very rare fourth-stage infected that have grown huge and resilient. They tear apart victims with brute force. Bloaters can rip and throw chunks of acidic mycotoxin (spore bombs) that explode on impact, burning victims with caustic spores. Slow-moving but incredibly tough, bullets and even flamethrowers only gradually take them down. | *Lore:* Bloaters were thought to be myths by some settlements due to rarity. One **journal at UEC** marvels that *"over a decade infected, and they keep changing"*, referring to a Bloater on campus. Joel encounters a Bloater in Bill's town high school, prompting Bill to curse *"Holy fuck!"* indicating even a hardened survivalist rarely sees one. It's speculated that environmental conditions affect Bloater formation, e.g., **drier climates** yield Bloaters, whereas **humid climates** produce Shamblers. The **"King of the Bloaters,"** the Rat King, formed in Seattle's sealed hospital, is basically multiple stage-4 infected fused. |
| **Shambler** (Alt. Stage 4) | Long-term infected variant (many years, in wet environments). Bloated, diseased body with **pustules** and a head encased in fungus (but not as hard-plated as a Bloater). | **Acidic spore emitters:** Shamblers are a regional mutation encountered notably in Seattle (a very damp climate). They charge clumsily at targets and upon proximity or death, they **burst a cloud of corrosive spores** that burn and blister anything nearby. They lack the armored plates of Bloaters, so their bodies are softer, but their spore bursts make up for it as a deadly offense/defense. They often appear in packs. | *Lore:* WLF soldiers spread rumors of "new Infected" in the Seattle area, initially disbelieved until encounters confirmed it. A WLF note describes patrols losing members to **"airborne acid burns"**, a Shamblers' doing. Scientific in-game text (from quick-turn subtitles) suggests heavy rainfall influenced the Cordyceps growth, causing a Bloater to mutate into a Shambler. Interestingly, **Shamblers are also found in Santa Barbara**, which contradicts the humidity theory (perhaps underground sewers there). It's implied by game dialogue this was surprising to characters too. Shamblers illustrate the Cordyceps' adaptability. |
| **The Rat King** (Unique) | A singular anomaly: an amalgamation of multiple infected (at least one Bloater, several Clickers/Stalkers) fused over ~25 years. It appears as a giant mass of fungal and human limbs, almost boss-monster like. | **"Super-infected" abomination:** The Rat King possesses monstrous strength (it can smash through solid walls). It is extremely tough to kill, absorbing immense firepower. In combat, parts of it (like a Stalker fused in) can rip off, one **detached Stalker** even throws spore bombs like a mini-bloater. It emits many infected vocalizations at once. Fortunately, it's unique to the ground-zero area of Seattle's hospital. | *Lore:* The Rat King is described by Nora as comprised of *"the first people infected on outbreak day"* in Seattle, sealed in the hospital's quarantine zone for decades. Essentially, so many infected piled up in close quarters that the Cordyceps grew them together into one being (hence "Rat King," a term from folklore for rats tangled by their tails). Abby's shock at seeing it shows even the WLF never knew it existed, it's a stuff of nightmares. The developers confirmed it's a one-off and **the most powerful infected known**. After Abby kills it with fire and explosives, the threat is eliminated. The Rat King emphasizes how far the infection can go in worst-case scenarios, a culmination of stages into something almost unthinkable. |

**Other Adversaries:** Besides the infected, human enemies pose significant threats shaped by the world's collapse. Key factions and hostile groups include:

- **FEDRA Military:** The authoritarian remnants of the U.S. government in quarantine zones. FEDRA soldiers are encountered mainly early (Boston). They enforce martial law, rationing, curfews, and execute infected or dissidents without trial. While they maintain order (Boston QZ survived 20 years under FEDRA), their cruelty (hanging or shooting civilians) birthed resistance like the Fireflies. By Part II (25 years post-outbreak), FEDRA has fallen in many regions (Boston's QZ fell shortly after Joel and Ellie left, according to a note; Seattle's QZ fell to WLF in **2017**). Some FEDRA remnants likely became WLF or other militias. In gameplay, FEDRA are typically encountered as tutorial enemies (e.g., when Joel and Ellie sneak out of Boston). **Lore tidbits:** Pamphlets and posters reveal FEDRA's strict rules. One **Boston directive** references ration cards and curfew sirens. In Ish's story, FEDRA never reached some communities in time, explaining pockets of survivors like in Pittsburgh suburbs. Ultimately, FEDRA is portrayed as a rigid, oppressive regime that, while preventing total anarchy in QZs, often exacerbated human suffering and sowed the seeds for rebellion.

- **Fireflies:** A decentralized militia group formed by Marlene and others to oppose FEDRA and seek a vaccine. Their slogan "When you're lost in the darkness, look for the light" is seen in graffiti everywhere. In Part I, the Fireflies are crucial: Marlene orchestrates getting Ellie to the Firefly doctors. They **believe in Ellie's immunity as the key to a cure** and are willing to let her die to produce it. Fireflies are idealistic but pragmatic, they bombed military targets and led uprisings in QZs. **In-game lore:** pendants (dog tags) collected by Joel show many Fireflies died in action. Marlene's journals and voice recorders give insight: she struggled with losing men on the way to Salt Lake (she notes how seeing her comrades lifted by hope at reuniting in SLC made her resolve firm). After Joel's rampage, **the Fireflies largely disband**, a text in Part II says remaining Fireflies voted to disband after losing their only doctor and leader. However, a group of former Fireflies (including Abby's friends and Owen) sought each other out in Santa Barbara, trying to reform. Owen's last wish was to rejoin them, and Abby/Lev's ending implies they intend to meet those reformed Fireflies on Catalina Island. The Fireflies thus represent the **hope for civilization's resurgence**, though their fate is unclear by 2039. They are viewed differently by characters: to FEDRA and some civilians, Fireflies were "terrorists," to sympathetic survivors they were freedom fighters. Abby and her crew being ex-Fireflies underscores how, even after disbanding, their members remained connected (leading Abby to her revenge opportunity via Firefly intel). In summary, the Fireflies reflect the theme of sacrificing the few for the many, a noble cause, but one the game constantly questions through Joel's opposite choice.

- **Hunters (Bandits):** "Hunters" is a term Joel uses for the groups of chaotic survivors who ambush travelers for supplies, notably in Pittsburgh. Without strong governance, many QZs (like Pittsburgh, Hartford) collapsed and survivors formed raider clans. They have no formal uniform or ideology beyond survival and greed. In Pittsburgh, their origin is explained in an artifact: after FEDRA pulled out, mobs lynched the remaining soldiers and took over. These hunters killed innocent people (Ellie finds a trap where they lured tourists with fake evacuation notices). Joel, having been on both sides of ambushes, quickly recognized their tactics. Gameplay-wise, hunters are encountered in Pittsburgh (Part I) and as generic raiders in the University and David's group. **David's group** at Silver Lake can be seen as a later-stage hunter group, forced into cannibalism to survive winter. David even mentions they **"send groups to scavenge"** University and such, implying some hunters are semi-organized. **Lore:** A note in Pittsburgh from a military backpack describes how they "lost the zone" to violent rebels, showing how ordinary desperate civilians became the ruthless hunters Joel and Ellie face. Hunters underscore the collapse of morality when law is gone, they're a constant human threat in TLoU, reminding players that not only the infected are dangerous. Joel admits to Ellie he's done what hunters do (*"I've been on both sides"*), indicating many otherwise decent people resorted to such behavior to survive early on. Part II doesn't focus on generic hunters as much because the conflict is dominated by organized factions, but the Rattlers in Santa Barbara are essentially a slaver variant of hunter, opportunistic and cruel.

- **Washington Liberation Front (WLF / "Wolves"):** A paramilitary militia in Seattle formed from ex-FEDRA soldiers and QZ civilians, led by Isaac Dixon. They overthrew FEDRA in Seattle circa 2017 via a brutal uprising. **WLF Ideology:** Initially freedom for QZ citizens, but after winning, they established a martial rule similar to FEDRA but with a "for the people" spin. They heavily armed themselves with leftover military equipment (they have APCs, ammunition caches, even trained guard dogs). By 2038, the WLF control Seattle's downtown and stadium (where their base/community is), but are at war with Seraphites over territory beyond the walls. Many WLF, like Abby's friends, are former Fireflies who joined because they had nowhere else (a Firefly recording in Santa Barbara calls the WLF *"a bunch of fascists"* which ironically is what they fought against). The WLF are shown committing atrocities too: Isaac authorized torturing and bombing Seraphite areas, and executing any suspected Seraphite collaborator. Still, within the WLF, there's camaraderie, we see them playing cards, watching movies (as Abby mentions to Lev), and caring about each other's lives. Characters like Owen become disillusioned with WLF's endless war, indicating ideological cracks. **Gameplay/lore:** WLF soldiers frequently call each other by name and react emotionally when comrades die, underscoring they're not faceless goons but people. They use attack dogs to sniff out intruders, one WLF memo details training **"military dogs"** for patrol, a new threat Ellie faces (and can choose to avoid or kill, with even that given emotional weight). The WLF's rise and partial fall (by Abby's story end, many of their best fighters died on the Seraphite island and presumably Isaac's death caused chaos) illustrate how revolutionary groups can become what they hated. They essentially replaced FEDRA in Seattle, evidence being prisoners Ellie finds (captured Seraphites) tortured similarly to how FEDRA treated Fireflies. The WLF motto appears to be **"May your survival be long; may your death be swift"**, a phrase said among soldiers (like when Manny toasts that before the operation). Abby, a top WLF soldier, ultimately betrays the WLF (by rebelling against Isaac to save Lev). By Part II's end, with Abby gone and many leaders dead, the WLF's status is unclear. Possibly they retreat after the failed island offensive. 

- **Seraphites ("Scars"):** A religious cult in Seattle who shun technology and follow the teachings of a prophet. Origin: A woman ("the Prophet") emerged post-outbreak preaching about returning to simplicity and condemning the "old world's sins" (like excessive reliance on tech). The timeline notes as early as 2014 a miracle story of survivors led by a **"strange woman"** in Seattle, that's likely the Prophet founding the Seraphites. They settled on a wooded island and parts of Seattle suburbs, living in communes, farming, and using bows and handmade weapons. Their nickname "Scars" comes from their practice of **cutting scars on their cheeks** to show devotion. They communicate with eerie **whistles** in combat. By 2038, Seraphites are locked in a vicious war with WLF, triggered after WLF killed their Prophet a few years prior (martyring her, which only strengthened Seraphite resolve). **Beliefs:** They view the Cordyceps outbreak as punishment for humanity's sins (a pseudo-Christian tone, calling infected "demons" and using religious imagery). They forbid old-world luxuries; Seraphite elders even punish those who look at reflections (Lev says *"it's vanity, indulgent"* about why mirrors are smashed in Seraphite dwellings). They're patriarchal in leadership, Lev was to be a "wife" (an assigned role) which he fled. The Seraphites greet each other with **"May she guide you"**, referring to the Prophet. They also frequently quote her teachings: e.g., *"**After all we've lost, we're still here.**"* Their environment is decorated with shrines and her paintings. In game, they are formidable with stealth, they often ambush using grass and make little noise aside from whistles. They use melee weapons like axes, sickles, and bows that allow silent kills. **Notable characters:** Lev and Yara are Seraphite apostates, offering an inside look: many Seraphites are not evil, but indoctrinated. They cared for each other in their community (Lev's mom truly believed he was sinning, showing tragedy of their dogma). The Seraphites raze and hang WLF victims as warnings (Abby witnesses bodies hanging, entrails out, matching the scene where she was nearly hanged before Yara and Lev saved her). Their war with WLF culminates in the island battle which is visually akin to a medieval battle, showing how the world has regressed. **Lore collectibles:** One finds artifacts like **prophet's pamphlets** or Seraphite scriptures, e.g., carving of her sayings: *"Becoming one with the earth is the true death"* (hence they don't burn bodies, they return them to earth). Isaac mentions the Seraphites had a **"elder system"** (a council of elders leading after Prophet's death). By the end, the Seraphites suffer huge casualties (island on fire, many killed). It's left ambiguous if Seraphites remain a threat, likely diminished, but their fanaticism might persist among survivors. They underscore themes of **faith vs. fanaticism, and how children (Lev) can suffer under rigid traditions**.

- **Cannibals (David's Group at Silver Lake):** In Part I's winter, Ellie encounters David and James who lead a desperate group resorting to cannibalism. **David** outwardly is kind and paternal, but is revealed as a controlling, predatory figure (implied pedophilic interest in Ellie and clearly manipulative with his flock). His group originally were ordinary survivors from a quarantine zone (David says they were from a "larger group" that moved for food). They struggled with starvation and David guided them to eating human flesh to survive, possibly rationalizing it as God's will (he mentions *"when you're starving, you'll take any chance"*). Most of David's people (like the woman who begs him to seek revenge on Joel/Ellie for killing Alec, her father) might not know they're eating humans, David lies it's venison (shown by the **"venison"** labeling of human meat). **Cannibal lore:** This is a taboo line many survivors won't cross, even Abby's group in Seattle, starving, did not go cannibal; but isolated pockets like David's did. A letter in the mines near the Resort (Left Behind DLC) also hinted at survivors considering cannibalism. David's group specifically hunted humans: Ellie finds a **barn of hung bodies** being bled, indicating an organized operation. This group's fate ends with Ellie killing David, likely collapsing thereafter. Cannibals appear again as the Rattlers who casually mention feeding prisoners to infected or worse, a different flavor (cruelty rather than necessity). These instances emphasize the **extremes of human depravity** in dire times. David's charismatic villainy highlights Ellie's strength and also serves as a comparison: David calls them *"alike"* (both violent leaders), which Ellie furiously rejects by hacking him to death. Cannibals in TLoU are universally painted negatively, aligning with the series' exploration of how far survival can push people and the line Ellie/Joel/Abby won't cross (none of our heroes ever consider cannibalism, it's a moral event horizon, separating them from truly lost groups).

- **Rattlers:** Introduced at the end of Part II, the Rattlers are a gang in Santa Barbara who enslave survivors and **capture infected** (they leash infected as watchdogs, seen by strung-up Clickers used as perimeter guards). They dress in biker-like attire with skull bandanas. They appear to be ex-military or biker gang members who filled the power vacuum in California. **Motivation:** Pure sadism and slavery. They force captives to do labor (Ellie frees slaves in a cell who mention many died from work or torture). The Rattlers' base is a repurposed luxury estate fenced with high-tech security, implying they have maintained some technology and comfort by exploiting others. They are clearly less disciplined than WLF, they taunt Ellie cockily, suggesting arrogance. Their slang and demeanor (one calls Ellie "little bitch" and boasts about stringing up "trespassers") show a raider mentality. In combat they use firearms and traps, but lack formal tactics. **Lore:** Not much backstory is given, but one can infer from graffiti and notes: they call themselves "Rattlers" likely because of using rattlesnakes or imagery (and ironically get bitten by their own pet rattlesnake in one scene, which Ellie exploits). A **Runaway's note** Ellie finds describes slaves being terrified of being "chained up again" by Rattlers. Another detail: when Ellie stealth-kills a Rattler, others might joke *"probably got taken out by infected, he was soft"*, indicating their callous culture where dying is mocked unless avenged. Abby and Lev being captured by them allowed the story to set up the final showdown in a way that Abby is at her weakest (giving Ellie the physical edge, but morally Abby had changed). The Rattlers draw parallels to real-world slave raiders or modern warlord groups. Ellie efficiently wipes them out on her way to Abby, symbolically dismantling a mini-evil regime, one redemptive thing she does in Santa Barbara aside from her personal quest. The Rattlers show that even 25 years post-outbreak, **new factions of cruelty can emerge**, filling voids where Fireflies or FEDRA vanished. They serve as final antagonists that the player feels no remorse eliminating, contrasting the moral complexity of WLF/Seraphites.
