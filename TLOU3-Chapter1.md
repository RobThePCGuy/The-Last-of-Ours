# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 1: The Wanderer

Ellie pressed her back against the rusted door of the roadside diner, listening to the wet gurgles on the other side. Two Infected lurched in the shadows of the kitchen, their snarls echoing off metal walls. Her grip tightened around the handle of her machete. In the narrow beam of morning light that pierced a grime-coated window, dust motes danced, almost peaceful, if not for the monsters shambling closer.

With a steadying breath, Ellie kicked the door wide. A runner lunged immediately, a gaunt man in tattered flannel, eyes milky and skin mottled with cordyceps growths. Ellie sidestepped and swung hard. The machete's blade struck true, slicing clean through the runner's neck. He dropped with a thud. The second infected, a woman whose lower jaw hung by a thread of sinew, stumbled over the corpse, hissing. Ellie didn't hesitate. She buried the machete into the creature's skull with a sickening crunch.

Silence fell inside the diner save for Ellie's heavy breathing. She wiped the blade on her jeans and surveyed the dim space. The smell of decade-old grease and moldy decay clung to everything. Broken stools and overturned tables littered the floor. Behind the counter, the kitchen door swung gently on one hinge. If any more lurked back there, they would have rushed at the commotion by now. Still, Ellie moved cautiously, listening. Only the distant drip of water from a leaking pipe reached her ears.

"Clear," she murmured to herself, her voice hollow in the emptiness. She stepped back outside, squinting against the California sun rising over the horizon. The diner sat at the edge of a dusty highway, nothing around for miles but dry scrub and abandoned cars rusting in the golden light. By one of those cars, a small group of survivors waited anxiously, a middle-aged man clutching a shotgun, his wife holding their young daughter close. They watched Ellie with a mix of gratitude and disbelief.

"It's safe now," Ellie called out, sliding her machete into the sheath on her backpack. She tried to muster a reassuring smile. "You can get your supplies."

The man exhaled in relief. "Thank you," he said, lowering the shotgun. "We... we couldn't have done that on our own."

Ellie shrugged off the praise, already walking past them. "Just be careful on your way back," she replied. She picked up her weathered canvas pack from where she'd left it by the road. Behind her, the couple hurried into the diner to scavenge canned food and medical kits they'd seen earlier, their child in tow. Ellie didn't stick around for thanks or rewards. She'd done what she came to do, helped them clear the place of infected, and now it was time to move on.

As she strode toward the horizon, the little girl's voice piped up behind her. "Are you leaving? You can stay with us. We have a camp."

Ellie paused, her heart clenching unexpectedly at the innocent offer. She turned, seeing the girl, maybe seven years old, big brown eyes peeking from a dirt-smudged face. Ellie forced a gentle smile. "That's real nice of you," she said. "But I've got my own road to follow."

The girl's mother had knelt to ruffle her daughter's hair. "Let the lady go, sweetie. She has places to be." The woman offered Ellie a grateful nod. "Safe travels. I wish there was more we could do to thank you."

Ellie shook her head. "Just take care of each other," she replied softly. A familiar ache tugged at her chest as she watched the family disappear into the diner. The child's hopeful face reminded her of another little girl from long ago, one who had wanted nothing more than to feel safe. In a flash, Ellie saw herself at that age, scared and yearning for protection. She blinked the memory away before it could cut deeper.

Hoisting her pack over her shoulder, Ellie continued down the highway. Her boots kicked up little puffs of dust with each step. She had been wandering like this for months, drifting from one place to the next, never staying anywhere too long. It was easier to keep moving; roots only gave the pain a place to catch up. At twenty-one, she felt far older, each year etched into the scars on her skin: the bite mark on her forearm, the knife wound on her side, the missing two fingers on her left hand that would never strum a guitar properly again.

The morning wore on hot and dry. Ellie kept to the road when it was clear, detouring into the scrub when the clogged remains of traffic forced her off the pavement. Sometimes she'd come across old quarantine zone signs or the husks of military checkpoints, ghosts of FEDRA's failed control in the early outbreak days. Whenever she spotted the sun-bleached Firefly graffiti on a wall "When you're lost in the darkness, look for the light", it twisted something in her gut: regret, longing, she wasn't sure.

Around midday, Ellie found a shaded spot beneath the crumbling overpass of Interstate 5 and stopped to rest. She unslung her pack and dug out a dented metal canteen. Taking a swig of lukewarm water, she stared out at the landscape of scrub brush and distant hills shimmering in heat. Alone with the quiet, her thoughts grew louder, an endless churn of memory and remorse.

Often, when solitude pressed in like this, she would imagine him. And just like that, Joel was sitting beside her, boots stretched out, strumming an absent tune on his guitar. Of course, he wasn't really there, Joel had been dead for over two years. But in these lonely moments Ellie could almost hear his voice as clearly as if he were alive.

"Still playin' the drifter, huh?" Imaginary Joel leaned back against the concrete pillar, his warm Southern drawl cutting through the silence.

Ellie closed her eyes. A faint smile ghosted her lips. "Got no one left to play house with," she answered quietly, in her mind. "Nothin' to keep me in one place."

Joel's voice softened. "You know that ain't true, baby girl."

Her chest tightened. Baby girl. She hadn't let herself hear him say that in so long. Ellie drew her knees up, wrapping one arm around them. "Maybe not," she whispered aloud, words directed to a ghost. "But it sure feels like it."

For a moment, the only sound was the wind whistling through the cracked highway. Ellie pictured Joel watching her with that concerned furrow of his brow, the way he used to when he could tell she was hurting. How many nights had she confessed her fears to him by a campfire? How many times had he talked her through nightmares until dawn?

A memory drifted to her, the two of them on patrol in Jackson, years ago. Joel had pointed out the sunset turning the snow-covered trees golden. "There's beauty to find, even now," he'd said. "You just gotta be willing to see it." At the time she'd rolled her eyes, teased him for sounding like some wise old hermit. Now she yearned for that simple wisdom.

"I messed up, Joel," she murmured, resting her forehead on her arms. In her mind, she saw Joel tilt his head, inviting her to go on. The words spilled out bitter and quiet: "I had it. I almost had peace and I threw it away. I couldn't let it go... what happened to you."

In her mind's eye Joel's expression clouded with pain. "Ellie, " he began, but she barreled on.

"I left her. I left Dina. After everything she did for me, I... I walked away." Ellie's throat constricted. She remembered that night vividly, standing in the farmhouse nursery, guitar in hand, Dina's plea unspoken but clear in her eyes: Don't go. Ellie had gone anyway, chasing vengeance to the shores of California. "I don't even know where she is now. If she's safe. If she hates me."

The Joel in her mind let out a sigh and looked off into the distance. "I can't say what Dina's feelin'. But she had her reasons. You both been through more than anyone should."

Ellie picked at the fraying strap of her backpack. A crow cawed somewhere overhead. "I wish you were here," she admitted in a trembling whisper. "You'd know what to do. Or at least... I wouldn't feel so damn lost."

She imagined Joel shifting closer, the scent of sawdust and leather filling her head, memories of his jacket when he'd hug her. "You keep goin', that's what you do," he said gently. "One foot in front of the other. Find somethin' worth keepin' on for."

Ellie huffed a small, humorless laugh. "Worth keeping on for, huh?" She opened her eyes, the illusion of Joel fading in the harsh light of noon. "Got any suggestions?" she asked the empty air.

No answer came. Joel was gone, just as he'd been for years. Ellie dragged a hand over her face, feeling foolish and alone. Talking to ghosts, maybe she really was losing it.

With a groan, she pushed herself to her feet. The sun was high and she had many miles to cover before nightfall. She couldn't afford to wallow. Securing her pack, Ellie started walking north along the overpass and then down an embankment back to the highway.

By dusk, she reached the outskirts of a small settlement, just a ragtag collection of pre-outbreak houses reinforced with scrap metal walls. She'd heard about this place from a traveler weeks ago: a community of survivors near the old city of Redding. They were said to be friendly enough to outsiders, trading supplies and news. With the light fading orange across the sky, Ellie decided to approach, if only to get some information and maybe a safe night's rest nearby.

She kept her hands visible as she neared the main gate, announcing herself. Guards eyed her warily, but when they saw she was alone and not a threat, they allowed her to talk to their leader, a gruff but courteous woman named Grace. After some cautious conversation, Ellie traded a bundle of antibiotics she'd found in an abandoned pharmacy for a hot meal and the latest gossip from down south.

"People say there's a group out there calling themselves the Fireflies," Grace told her over a dinner of canned beans and rice. They sat in a garage strung with Christmas lights, repurposed as the settlement's common room. Around them, a handful of off-duty lookouts played cards while children dozed in corners. "They're hiding out on some island off the coast. Spreading word that they're trying to start over, gather folks to rebuild, maybe even work on a cure again."

Ellie's spoon paused halfway to her lips. Her heart thudded. "A cure?" she echoed carefully, masking the tremor in her voice.

Grace nodded. "I dunno if it's truth or just a dream they're selling. But they've been asking around for certain people... special people." She narrowed her eyes at Ellie as if weighing something. "Heard one rumor that they're looking for anyone who's immune."

The bite of beans in Ellie's mouth turned to ash. She forced herself to swallow. "Immune?" she repeated, feigning puzzlement. "Immune how? Like... to the infection?"

"Yeah." Grace leaned forward, lowering her voice. "Crazy, I know. Supposedly, they believe there's someone out there who can't turn. A person who already got bit and never changed. They think that's the key to everything. I guess twenty-odd years later, they're still chasing that pipe dream."

Ellie's pulse pounded in her ears. Her secret felt like a living thing beneath her skin, thrumming at the mention. She mustered a disinterested smirk. "Sounds like a long shot. I wouldn't put much stock in it."

"Me neither," Grace sighed. "But I thought if it were true... well, wouldn't that be somethin'? Hell, I'd cross the country to meet someone like that." She gave a little laugh and pushed up from the table. "Anyhow, you're welcome to camp outside our gates for the night. Safer than out in the open road."

Ellie realized her palms were sweaty. She nodded and offered a tense smile. "Thanks. I appreciate it."

That night, she lay on a cot just beyond the settlement's wall, staring up at a sky spattered with stars. The Fireflies... immune... a cure. Old words, old ghosts. She hadn't let herself truly think of those things in so long. It hurt too much, like probing a half-healed wound. Yet now, she could think of nothing else.

They're looking for someone like me.

Grace's voice echoed in her mind: I'd cross the country to meet someone like that.

Once upon a time, Ellie had meant to be that someone. Once, she'd carried the hope of a cure on her small shoulders, all the way to Salt Lake City, only to have Joel snatch it away because he couldn't bear to lose her. She understood him better now; she even forgave him in her heart. But the guilt of it, the unused potential in her blood, had never fully gone away.

Ellie reached into her jacket and pulled out a worn piece of wood strung with guitar strings, the guitar neck talisman she'd carved down from her broken instrument. Despite missing fingers, she could still manage a few chords on this jury-rigged piece. She plucked it absently, not enough to produce more than ghostly hints of notes. Joel's song came to her lips in a whisper: "If I ever were to lose you, I'd surely lose myself…" The words faded into a shaky breath.

She sat up, unable to lie still with her thoughts. The world was dark beyond the fence, crickets chirping. In her mind, Joel's presence hovered, attentive. "You're thinkin' about it, aren't you?" he asked quietly.

"I am," she answered voicelessly. "If there are Fireflies again... if they're really looking for me... maybe this is why I'm still here. Why I survived."

Imaginary Joel said nothing. She imagined him gazing at her with sad, knowing eyes.

Ellie clenched her jaw. A steely resolve kindled in her gut, a spark she hadn't felt since... Jackson? Maybe since that last day in the theater, when she'd chosen to spare Abby. It was purpose.

She stood and slung her pack over her shoulder, leaving the cot behind. The night air was cool on her face. She knew what she had to do.

"Goodbye, Joel," she murmured to the stars, hoping he'd understand why she needed to follow this through. Then Ellie turned toward the west, where the distant Pacific lay invisible beyond the mountains, and began the long walk toward whatever remained of the Fireflies, and toward whatever fate awaited the girl immune to the infection.
