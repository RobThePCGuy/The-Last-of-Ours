# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 1: The Wanderer

Ellie pressed her back against the rusted door of the roadside diner, listening to the wet gurgles on the other side. Two Infected lurched in the shadows of the kitchen, their snarls echoing off metal walls. Her grip tightened around the handle of her machete. In the narrow beam of morning light that pierced a grime-coated window, dust motes danced—almost peaceful, if not for the monsters shambling closer.

With a steadying breath, Ellie kicked the door wide. A runner lunged immediately, a gaunt man in tattered flannel, eyes milky and skin mottled with cordyceps growths. Ellie sidestepped and swung hard. The machete’s blade struck true, slicing clean through the runner’s neck. He dropped with a thud. The second infected—a woman whose lower jaw hung by a thread of sinew—stumbled over the corpse, hissing. Ellie didn’t hesitate. She buried the machete into the creature’s skull with a sickening crunch.

Silence fell inside the diner save for Ellie’s heavy breathing. She wiped the blade on her jeans and surveyed the dim space. The smell of decade-old grease and moldy decay clung to everything. Broken stools and overturned tables littered the floor. Behind the counter, the kitchen door swung gently on one hinge. If any more lurked back there, they would have rushed at the commotion by now. Still, Ellie moved cautiously, listening. Only the distant drip of water from a leaking pipe reached her ears.

“Clear,” she murmured to herself, her voice hollow in the emptiness. She stepped back outside, squinting against the California sun rising over the horizon. The diner sat at the edge of a dusty highway, nothing around for miles but dry scrub and abandoned cars rusting in the golden light. By one of those cars, a small group of survivors waited anxiously—a middle-aged man clutching a shotgun, his wife holding their young daughter close. They watched Ellie with a mix of gratitude and disbelief.

“It’s safe now,” Ellie called out, sliding her machete into the sheath on her backpack. She tried to muster a reassuring smile. “You can get your supplies.”

The man exhaled in relief. “Thank you,” he said, lowering the shotgun. “We… we couldn’t have done that on our own.”

Ellie shrugged off the praise, already walking past them. “Just be careful on your way back,” she replied. She picked up her weathered canvas pack from where she’d left it by the road. Behind her, the couple hurried into the diner to scavenge canned food and medical kits they’d seen earlier, their child in tow. Ellie didn’t stick around for thanks or rewards. She’d done what she came to do—helped them clear the place of infected—and now it was time to move on.

As she strode toward the horizon, the little girl’s voice piped up behind her. “Are you leaving? You can stay with us. We have a camp.”

Ellie paused, her heart clenching unexpectedly at the innocent offer. She turned, seeing the girl—maybe seven years old, big brown eyes peeking from a dirt-smudged face. Ellie forced a gentle smile. “That’s real nice of you,” she said. “But I’ve got my own road to follow.”

The girl’s mother had knelt to ruffle her daughter’s hair. “Let the lady go, sweetie. She has places to be.” The woman offered Ellie a grateful nod. “Safe travels. I wish there was more we could do to thank you.”

Ellie shook her head. “Just take care of each other,” she replied softly. A familiar ache tugged at her chest as she watched the family disappear into the diner. The child’s hopeful face reminded her of another little girl from long ago—one who had wanted nothing more than to feel safe. In a flash, Ellie saw herself at that age, scared and yearning for protection. She blinked the memory away before it could cut deeper.

Hoisting her pack over her shoulder, Ellie continued down the highway. Her boots kicked up little puffs of dust with each step. She had been wandering like this for months, drifting from one place to the next, never staying anywhere too long. It was easier to keep moving; roots only gave the pain a place to catch up. At twenty-one, she felt far older, each year etched into the scars on her skin: the bite mark on her forearm, the knife wound on her side, the missing two fingers on her left hand that would never strum a guitar properly again.

The morning wore on hot and dry. Ellie kept to the road when it was clear, detouring into the scrub when the clogged remains of traffic forced her off the pavement. Sometimes she’d come across old quarantine zone signs or the husks of military checkpoints—ghosts of FEDRA’s failed control in the early outbreak days. Whenever she spotted the sun-bleached Firefly graffiti on a wall (“When you’re lost in the darkness, look for the light”), it twisted something in her gut: regret, longing, she wasn’t sure.

Around midday, Ellie found a shaded spot beneath the crumbling overpass of Interstate 5 and stopped to rest. She unslung her pack and dug out a dented metal canteen. Taking a swig of lukewarm water, she stared out at the landscape of scrub brush and distant hills shimmering in heat. Alone with the quiet, her thoughts grew louder—an endless churn of memory and remorse.

Often, when solitude pressed in like this, she would imagine him. And just like that, Joel was sitting beside her, boots stretched out, strumming an absent tune on his guitar. Of course, he wasn’t really there—Joel had been dead for over two years. But in these lonely moments Ellie could almost hear his voice as clearly as if he were alive.

“Still playin’ the drifter, huh?” Imaginary Joel leaned back against the concrete pillar, his warm Southern drawl cutting through the silence.

Ellie closed her eyes. A faint smile ghosted her lips. “Got no one left to play house with,” she answered quietly, in her mind. “Nothin’ to keep me in one place.”

Joel’s voice softened. “You know that ain’t true, baby girl.”

Her chest tightened. *Baby girl.* She hadn’t let herself hear him say that in so long. Ellie drew her knees up, wrapping one arm around them. “Maybe not,” she whispered aloud, words directed to a ghost. “But it sure feels like it.”

For a moment, the only sound was the wind whistling through the cracked highway. Ellie pictured Joel watching her with that concerned furrow of his brow, the way he used to when he could tell she was hurting. How many nights had she confessed her fears to him by a campfire? How many times had he talked her through nightmares until dawn?

A memory drifted to her—the two of them on patrol in Jackson, years ago. Joel had pointed out the sunset turning the snow-covered trees golden. *“There’s beauty to find, even now,”* he’d said. *“You just gotta be willing to see it.”* At the time she’d rolled her eyes, teased him for sounding like some wise old hermit. Now she yearned for that simple wisdom.

“I messed up, Joel,” she murmured, resting her forehead on her arms. In her mind, she saw Joel tilt his head, inviting her to go on. The words spilled out bitter and quiet: “I had it. I almost had peace and I threw it away. I couldn’t let it go… what happened to you.”

In her mind’s eye Joel’s expression clouded with pain. *“Ellie—”* he began, but she barreled on.

“I left her. I left Dina. After everything she did for me, I… I walked away.” Ellie’s throat constricted. She remembered that night vividly—standing in the farmhouse nursery, guitar in hand, Dina’s plea unspoken but clear in her eyes: *Don’t go.* Ellie had gone anyway, chasing vengeance to the shores of California. “I don’t even know where she is now. If she’s safe. If she hates me.”

The Joel in her mind let out a sigh and looked off into the distance. *“I can’t say what Dina’s feelin’. But she had her reasons. You both been through more than anyone should.”*

Ellie picked at the fraying strap of her backpack. A crow cawed somewhere overhead. “I wish you were here,” she admitted in a trembling whisper. “You’d know what to do. Or at least… I wouldn’t feel so damn lost.”

She imagined Joel shifting closer, the scent of sawdust and leather filling her head—memories of his jacket when he’d hug her. *“You keep goin’, that’s what you do,”* he said gently. *“One foot in front of the other. Find somethin’ worth keepin’ on for.”*

Ellie huffed a small, humorless laugh. “Worth keeping on for, huh?” She opened her eyes, the illusion of Joel fading in the harsh light of noon. “Got any suggestions?” she asked the empty air.

No answer came. Joel was gone, just as he’d been for years. Ellie dragged a hand over her face, feeling foolish and alone. Talking to ghosts—maybe she really was losing it.

With a groan, she pushed herself to her feet. The sun was high and she had many miles to cover before nightfall. She couldn’t afford to wallow. Securing her pack, Ellie started walking north along the overpass and then down an embankment back to the highway.

By dusk, she reached the outskirts of a small settlement—just a ragtag collection of pre-outbreak houses reinforced with scrap metal walls. She’d heard about this place from a traveler weeks ago: a community of survivors near the old city of Redding. They were said to be friendly enough to outsiders, trading supplies and news. With the light fading orange across the sky, Ellie decided to approach, if only to get some information and maybe a safe night’s rest nearby.

She kept her hands visible as she neared the main gate, announcing herself. Guards eyed her warily, but when they saw she was alone and not a threat, they allowed her to talk to their leader—a gruff but courteous woman named Grace. After some cautious conversation, Ellie traded a bundle of antibiotics she’d found in an abandoned pharmacy for a hot meal and the latest gossip from down south.

“People say there’s a group out there calling themselves the Fireflies,” Grace told her over a dinner of canned beans and rice. They sat in a garage strung with Christmas lights, repurposed as the settlement’s common room. Around them, a handful of off-duty lookouts played cards while children dozed in corners. “They’re hiding out on some island off the coast. Spreading word that they’re trying to start over—gather folks to rebuild, maybe even work on a cure again.”

Ellie’s spoon paused halfway to her lips. Her heart thudded. “A cure?” she echoed carefully, masking the tremor in her voice.

Grace nodded. “I dunno if it’s truth or just a dream they’re selling. But they’ve been asking around for certain people… special people.” She narrowed her eyes at Ellie as if weighing something. “Heard one rumor that they’re looking for anyone who’s immune.”

The bite of beans in Ellie’s mouth turned to ash. She forced herself to swallow. “Immune?” she repeated, feigning puzzlement. “Immune how? Like… to the infection?”

“Yeah.” Grace leaned forward, lowering her voice. “Crazy, I know. Supposedly, they believe there’s someone out there who can’t turn. A person who already got bit and never changed. They think that’s the key to everything. I guess twenty-odd years later, they’re still chasing that pipe dream.”

Ellie’s pulse pounded in her ears. Her secret felt like a living thing beneath her skin, thrumming at the mention. She mustered a disinterested smirk. “Sounds like a long shot. I wouldn’t put much stock in it.”

“Me neither,” Grace sighed. “But I thought if it *were* true… well, wouldn’t that be somethin’? Hell, I’d cross the country to meet someone like that.” She gave a little laugh and pushed up from the table. “Anyhow, you’re welcome to camp outside our gates for the night. Safer than out in the open road.”

Ellie realized her palms were sweaty. She nodded and offered a tense smile. “Thanks. I appreciate it.”

That night, she lay on a cot just beyond the settlement’s wall, staring up at a sky spattered with stars. The Fireflies… immune… a cure. Old words, old ghosts. She hadn’t let herself truly think of those things in so long. It hurt too much—like probing a half-healed wound. Yet now, she could think of nothing else.

*They’re looking for someone like me.*

Grace’s voice echoed in her mind: *I’d cross the country to meet someone like that.*

Once upon a time, Ellie had meant to be that someone. Once, she’d carried the hope of a cure on her small shoulders, all the way to Salt Lake City—only to have Joel snatch it away because he couldn’t bear to lose her. She understood him better now; she even forgave him in her heart. But the guilt of it, the unused potential in her blood, had never fully gone away.

Ellie reached into her jacket and pulled out a worn piece of wood strung with guitar strings—the guitar neck talisman she’d carved down from her broken instrument. Despite missing fingers, she could still manage a few chords on this jury-rigged piece. She plucked it absently, not enough to produce more than ghostly hints of notes. Joel’s song came to her lips in a whisper: *“If I ever were to lose you, I’d surely lose myself…”* The words faded into a shaky breath.

She sat up, unable to lie still with her thoughts. The world was dark beyond the fence, crickets chirping. In her mind, Joel’s presence hovered, attentive. *“You’re thinkin’ about it, aren’t you?”* he asked quietly.

“I am,” she answered voicelessly. “If there are Fireflies again… if they’re really looking for me… maybe this is why I’m still here. Why I survived.”

Imaginary Joel said nothing. She imagined him gazing at her with sad, knowing eyes.

Ellie clenched her jaw. A steely resolve kindled in her gut, a spark she hadn’t felt since… Jackson? Maybe since that last day in the theater, when she’d chosen to spare Abby. It was purpose.

She stood and slung her pack over her shoulder, leaving the cot behind. The night air was cool on her face. She knew what she had to do.

“Goodbye, Joel,” she murmured to the stars, hoping he’d understand why she needed to follow this through. Then Ellie turned toward the west, where the distant Pacific lay invisible beyond the mountains, and began the long walk toward whatever remained of the Fireflies—and toward whatever fate awaited the girl immune to the infection.

## Chapter 2: Fireflies Reborn

The sound of waves gently lapping against the docks usually soothed Abby’s nerves. On Catalina Island, every evening carried the tang of salt air and a brief, peaceful hush at dusk. Abby Anderson stood at the end of an old pier turned lookout post, scanning the darkening horizon. Far across the water, the coast was a hazy line. Somewhere over there lay Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and countless ruins of the old world. Two years ago, Abby had crossed that water in search of a new beginning. Against all odds, she had found one.

Behind her, the settlement that the Fireflies had built on Catalina glowed with lantern light. Dozens of survivors milled about inside the repurposed resort complex—once a tourist getaway, now a fortified base. These were the new Fireflies: former soldiers, idealistic runaways, surviving Firefly veterans from a decade ago who answered the call when rumors spread of a regrouping. Abby had not expected to become a leader among them, but her determination and combat experience quickly made her essential. She taught them how to fight, how to defend their home, and most importantly, she shared the dream her father had died for: finding a cure.

A familiar voice called out from the shore. “Hey, Abs! You coming? Food’s getting cold!”

Abby turned to see Lev waving to her from the beach, a playful grin on his now less-boyish face. At sixteen, Lev’s lean frame had grown taller, and the last traces of childhood roundness were gone from his features. In the orange glow of the sunset, the scar of his former Seraphite life—a faint mark where his head had been shaved—was nearly invisible beneath the short crop of hair he now kept. He wore a patched Firefly jacket several sizes too big, and in his hands he held two tin bowls.

“Alright, I’m coming!” Abby shouted back, a small smile tugging at her lips. She took one last gaze toward the mainland. It was quiet tonight; nothing but gently bobbing waves and distant gulls. Satisfied, she slung her rifle over her shoulder and headed down the pier to join Lev.

They walked together up the beach toward the heart of the camp. As they passed the old stucco buildings of the resort, Abby nodded to a pair of sentries on patrol. They saluted her respectfully—an acknowledgment she still wasn’t entirely comfortable with. Two years ago, Abby had been a soldier in the Washington Liberation Front, leading missions in Seattle’s war. Now she led a very different kind of fight.

In the open courtyard that served as a mess hall, Lev handed Abby one of the bowls. It was stew again—canned beef mixed with island-grown vegetables. Abby’s stomach growled at the savory scent. The two of them sat on a low wall under a string of lights powered by a jury-rigged generator. Around them, other Fireflies chatted and ate under the early night sky.

Lev dug into his portion eagerly. Between bites he said, “Anna was asking if I could join the scout team heading to the north end of the island tomorrow. They’re checking out that grounded ferry for medical supplies.”

“Think you’re ready to play medic on your own?” Abby teased lightly. Lev had taken to training as a field medic and scout—roles that fit his nimble build and keen eyes. She spooned some stew and added, “Just be careful. I hear that ferry’s crawling with infected.”

Lev rolled his eyes dramatically. “I will. Besides, we cleared most of them last week.” He grew more serious for a moment. “If I find any surgical supplies… it could help Dr. Angela, right? In case we ever… you know, find them.”

Abby set her bowl down. She knew what he meant. If they ever found someone immune—*the person* who could turn everything around. “If we find them,” she echoed with measured hope. “Dr. Angela will definitely need every tool she can get.” Abby’s chest tightened briefly. The idea of a cure was both a guiding star and a painful reminder. Her father had died believing in that cause, scalpel in hand, about to operate on some immune girl. Abby had never even known the patient’s name; after the Fireflies fell apart, she only learned that a smuggler had killed all the doctors and fled with the girl. For years Abby’s heart had burned with vengeance for her father’s death. She got her revenge—Joel Miller paid in blood. But that vengeance hadn’t brought her father back, nor the world any closer to a cure. It was Lev who finally gave Abby’s life new purpose, and through him, she found her way back to her father’s dream.

Lev nudged her gently with his elbow, sensing her darkening mood. “Hey. We’ll find someone, Abby. We have leads. You said it yourself—patience, right?”

Abby looked at the teenager who had become like a brother to her. He always had a way of cutting through her gloom. She mustered a small smile. “Right. Patience.”

Truthfully, Abby had begun to wonder if immunity was a myth. They’d heard only fragments: old stories out of Jackson of a girl who survived bites (but Jackson’s folk were tight-lipped), or whispers from travelers of some immune out east that vanished. Nothing concrete. And Abby certainly never imagined the enemy she’d fought in Seattle could have been that very girl. Ellie’s name was never attached to those rumors in Abby’s presence—Ellie had remained a stranger with a grudge, not a possible savior.

Lev finished his stew and stretched. “I’ll be careful tomorrow. And tonight I’ll pack extra bandages, just in case.”

Abby bumped her shoulder against his. “That’s my medic.”

They sat in comfortable silence for a time, watching the last light drain from the sky. Abby found herself actually laughing when Lev recounted how he’d outsmarted Manny in a target practice contest that morning. Laughter felt foreign on her tongue, but good. The nightmares of Seattle and Santa Barbara had dulled with time. She still woke some nights thinking of Yara’s last moments, or hearing Tommy’s sniper shot, or seeing Joel’s face under her golf club. But those nights were becoming rarer. In their place, new memories were forming: Lev learning to fish off the pier; the cheers when their radio picked up a distant Firefly cell in New Mexico; the simple solace of not being hated or feared by those around her.

When they finished eating, Abby ruffled Lev’s hair affectionately (earning a squawk of protest about messing it up) and took the empty bowls back to the cookfire. The head cook, an older man named Luis, smiled at her. “Another day down,” he remarked.

“Another day,” Abby agreed. A day where she hadn’t had to kill anyone or watch someone die—a low bar, but one she was grateful to clear more often now.

Lev wandered off to chat with a pair of scouts, and Abby decided to turn in for the night. She needed rest; tomorrow brought another round of planning and radio calls. As she headed toward the building where her quarters were, she heard Dr. Angela’s voice through an open doorway.

“…blood tests came back inconclusive. It could be just a mutation in the sample, but—”

“Keep testing,” came another voice—their communications chief, Rowan. “If it’s a false lead, it’s a false lead. But if not…”

Abby slowed her step. She shouldn’t eavesdrop, but the topic was too enticing. They were discussing an immune candidate, she realized. Likely some sample sent by a contact. Her heart quickened. Could it be real this time?

Before she could listen further, Lev jogged up behind her. “Abby, you left your flashlight,” he said, holding out the small device. “You’ll need it. Power’s still spotty in the dorms.”

Abby blinked, shaken from her thoughts. “Oh, thanks.” She took the flashlight, giving one last glance toward the door where Dr. Angela was talking. Not tonight, she told herself. If it were big news, they would inform her. Patience.

She and Lev headed inside their building. It was one of the smaller former hotel structures, with sand still strewn across the tiled lobby floor. At the stairwell, Lev bounded up two steps at a time. Abby followed at a slower pace, rolling her stiff shoulder. Though still strong, her muscles ached more nowadays. She wasn’t twenty anymore, and the years of hard living left their marks. She had maintained some of her old training routine, but leadership duties often kept her off the exercise field. Her arms had lost some of the bulk from her WLF days, though she remained powerful by anyone’s standards.

On the second floor, Abby entered her room—simple but comfortable. Lev’s room was just across the hall. “Goodnight, Abby,” he called, ducking into his bunk. “Don’t stay up late reading those old science journals again.”

Abby chuckled. “No promises. Night, Lev.” She shut her door and leaned against it for a moment, a long exhale escaping her. These quiet moments, alone with her thoughts, were sometimes the hardest. She rubbed the beaded bracelet on her wrist—Alice’s name etched into one of the beads, in memory of her lost dog—and then reached under her cot. From a hidden box, she pulled out a photograph, its edges worn soft. It showed a much younger Abby hugging a tall man with kind eyes and a gentle smile. Her father. One of the other doctors had snapped the picture at the hospital just weeks before that fateful day. She allowed herself a few seconds to look at his face.

“We’re close, Dad,” she whispered. “I can feel it. We’ll find them.” She carefully returned the photo to its box and lay down on the cot.

The night was warm and still. Abby drifted into a light sleep, the murmurs of camp life quieting one by one. She dreamed she was back in that Salt Lake City hospital, wandering the empty halls. She was calling for her father, but only her echo answered. Somewhere in the distance, she heard the faint strum of a guitar and a young girl’s voice humming a song—an eerie melody that made her heart pound with inexplicable sorrow.

A thunderous boom jolted Abby awake. The walls shook. For a split second, she thought she was still dreaming—memories of explosions during the WLF-Seraphite war bleeding into the present. But as a second blast resounded, Abby leapt off the cot, adrenaline surging.

Shouts erupted outside. Abby snatched her rifle and flung open the door. Across the hall, Lev stumbled out of his room, eyes wide and alarmed. “What’s happening?!” he yelled over the din.

“I don’t know,” Abby shouted back. “Stay close!”

They rushed down the stairs two at a time. Through a window, Abby caught sight of muzzle flashes and silhouettes moving in the courtyard. Gunfire rattled through the night. An alarm bell clanged—a shrill, desperate sound.

Abby’s heart tightened. The camp was under attack.

By the time they reached the ground floor, people were scrambling everywhere. A scout burst into the lobby, bleeding from a wound in her side. “We’re under attack—an armed group from the mainland!” she gasped. “They have the docks surrounded.”

Abby nodded sharply, forcing herself into a soldier’s clarity. “Get to cover and put pressure on that wound. Lev—take her to the clinic.”

Lev’s face was taut with fear, but he nodded and slid under the scout’s arm, helping her toward the back rooms where Dr. Angela had her infirmary.

Abby sprinted toward the front entrance. As she emerged into the courtyard, chaos greeted her. Several buildings were on fire, throwing flickering light and shadows across the scene. She saw her fellow Fireflies scattered, exchanging gunfire with figures in dark armor who advanced with military precision. The attackers moved in coordinated formation, forcing the Fireflies to retreat toward the center of camp. They were well-armed—Abby glimpsed assault rifles, shotguns, even a flamethrower carried by a hulking man setting cabins ablaze.

Abby ducked behind a concrete planter just as bullets sprayed her way. She popped up to return fire, managing to hit one attacker who had flanked left. He crumpled with a cry. Another explosion rocked the night—likely a grenade. The attackers were closing in relentlessly.

“Fall back to the rec center!” Abby shouted, hoping her voice would rally some defense. That building was sturdier; they could bottleneck the enemy. She saw Rowan, the communications chief, dragging a wounded comrade toward cover. Not far, Dr. Angela crouched behind an overturned table, holding a pistol with trembling hands.

Abby fired again, dropping a second invader who tried to rush the clinic door. For an instant, she locked eyes with the man behind him—a tall figure wearing a Kevlar vest emblazoned with a strange insignia: a painted white C crossed with a lightning bolt. He snarled something at her she couldn’t hear over the commotion.

Suddenly, from the corner of her eye, Abby saw Lev reappear at the infirmary doorway. “Lev, no!” she screamed, but her voice drowned in the thunder of gunfire.

Lev had his bow in hand and released an arrow that found the neck of an assailant about to torch the clinic. The man fell, dropping the Molotov that whooshed harmlessly on the ground. Lev looked to Abby for just a moment, checking she was alright. That moment was his mistake.

The tall man with the white C insignia turned his rifle toward Lev. Abby saw the muzzle flare—

*BANG!* The shot echoed.

Lev jerked as the bullet struck him in the chest. Time seemed to slow. Abby’s scream tore from her throat, raw and wordless, as Lev crumpled to the ground.

“No! LEV!” Abby barreled out from behind the planter, firing wildly at the man who’d shot Lev. Her vision blurred with fury and panic. She felt a searing pain crease her thigh—she’d been hit—but she didn’t care. The shooter tried to back away as she charged, but Abby slammed into him with the force of a freight train. They both hit the dirt.

In a frenzy, Abby smashed the butt of her rifle into the man’s face once, twice—his nose crunched and he yelled, grappling with her. He was strong, but adrenaline made Abby stronger. She rolled on top of him, hands closing around his throat. Her fingers dug into his flesh. “You son of a—” she snarled, squeezing with all her might. The man thrashed, choking. His fist pounded feebly against her side, but Abby didn’t relent. At the edges of her vision she could see more of the attackers swarming the courtyard, and the shapes of Fireflies either fleeing or dying. But nothing existed except the man beneath her, the one who shot Lev.

With a final, brutal twist, she heard his neck snap. Abby flung his limp body aside, gasping for breath.

Before she could gather herself, a heavy blow struck the back of her head. Stars exploded in her eyes and she pitched forward. The world spun. Someone must have snuck up behind her… She tried to push up from the ground, but another impact—a boot connecting with her ribs—sent her collapsing onto her side. Pain shot through her torso, and she tasted coppery blood on her tongue.

Abby’s vision went in and out of focus. She glimpsed at least four attackers left standing. A distant part of her realized she was going to die here, on a random island, all her efforts for nothing. Worse, Lev… *Lev.* She couldn’t see him from this angle. Please, she begged silently, let him be okay. Let this all be a nightmare.

Blackness crept at the edges of her sight as two figures loomed over her. One said something, and they grabbed Abby by her arms, beginning to drag her. She tried to struggle, but consciousness slipped like sand through her fingers. The last thing she remembered was the smear of blood on the ground—whether it was hers or Lev’s, she couldn’t tell—as darkness overtook her.

## Chapter 3: The Ambush

A sharp pain in her wrists pulled Abby from the void. Her eyes snapped open. For a moment she didn’t know where she was or what had happened. The smell of smoke and blood brought it rushing back like a tidal wave. She was on her knees in the courtyard, hands bound tightly behind her to a metal post. Her head throbbed where she’d been struck, and when she tried to move, a fiery ache radiated from her bruised ribs and thigh. Night still blanketed the sky, but it was filled with flickering orange light from fires that still burned around the camp.

There were bodies on the ground—some wearing the Firefly symbol, others in the attackers’ dark gear. Abby’s stomach lurched at the sheer number of people motionless in pools of blood. *How long was I out?* she wondered hazily. It couldn’t have been more than minutes.

Voices cut through the ringing in her ears.

“—round up the rest. Check the buildings,” barked a man to her left. Abby turned her head and saw a stout, bearded figure giving orders. He wore the same Kevlar with the white C emblem. A leader, by the way others obeyed him without question. “We need to move before more of them return.”

Nearby, two of his soldiers dragged Dr. Angela out of the clinic, her legs struggling weakly. Angela’s eyes were wide with terror above a gag. The soldiers shoved her to her knees and restrained her.

Abby’s blood boiled. She flexed her arms against the zip-ties cutting into her wrists, testing for any give. None.

A third soldier emerged from a collapsed hut hauling Rowan with a pistol to his head. Rowan’s face was bloodied, but he was alive.

The leader—Beard, Abby named him silently—strode closer and surveyed the hostages: Abby, Rowan, Dr. Angela, and a couple of terrified young recruits held at gunpoint by the remaining attackers. Beard’s jaw clenched as he looked at the bodies scattered around. His eyes landed on the corpse of the man Abby had strangled. His face twisted with grief and rage.

“Eli… damn you,” Beard hissed under his breath. He marched up to Abby and backhanded her viciously across the face. Abby grunted, seeing stars again.

“You,” he growled, grabbing a fistful of Abby’s hair and forcing her to meet his eyes. His face was inches from hers, teeth bared. “You killed my little brother. Do you know that?” Spittle hit her cheek. “He came here to clean out a nest of murderers, and you *killed* him.”

Little brother—Abby realized in a detached way that he meant the man she strangled, or maybe someone else tonight. Her thoughts were sluggish, still fogged by the blow to her head. “You invaded *us*,” she rasped, tasting blood from her split lip. “Who… who are you people?”

He yanked her hair harder. “We are the Commonwealth,” he snarled. “We’re the ones who will bring order back to this country, starting by stamping out terrorist trash like you.”

Commonwealth? Abby’s mind raced. She had heard distant chatter on the radio about a rising faction out of California calling themselves that—a group bent on taking power wherever FEDRA and others had left a vacuum. She hadn’t known they’d taken interest in the Fireflies. Terrorists, he said, like the old FEDRA propaganda. They thought the Fireflies were terrorists restarting a war.

Beard’s gaze flicked to Abby’s chest, where a faded Firefly pendant hung around her neck—a keepsake of her father’s, now an open declaration of loyalty. “Fireflies had their chance at this world, and they failed,” he spat. “We’re not about to let you come back.”

A soldier jogged up and saluted the leader. “Sir, we found a boat hidden on the west cove. Loaded with supplies and letters… looks like they were communicating with people on the mainland. Orders, rendezvous points.”

Beard sneered at Abby. “Trying to rebuild your little rebellion everywhere, huh? Not on my watch.” He released her hair, letting her head slump. Abby’s heart pounded as she grasped what this was—they hadn’t attacked for resources or out of random malice. They aimed to exterminate the Fireflies before they could regain strength. And she had led them right to a significant group of them, collected in one place.

The leader paced, fury rolling off him in waves. “Gather anything useful from their comms center. Burn the rest. And sink that boat.”

As his soldiers moved to obey, Abby’s eyes desperately scanned the courtyard for any sign of Lev. *Please,* she begged silently, *if there’s a god…*

Her gaze fell on a small, still form lying near the steps of the clinic. There, half in shadow, was Lev. He lay on his back where he fell, bow still clutched loosely in one hand. A dark stain spread across his shirt where the bullet hit. He wasn’t moving.

All air rushed from Abby’s lungs. She strained forward with a choked sound. “Lev!” she screamed, voice cracking. “LEV!”

Beard barely spared a glance. “He’s dead. You will be too, soon enough.” He motioned to one of the men. “We got what we needed from the doctor and the radio guy. As for the rest—” he looked at Abby with cold hatred, “finish them off.”

The soldier nodded and cocked his rifle, stepping toward Abby first. Time slowed again, but this time with crystal clarity. Abby felt a cold calm wash over her, a singular focus sharpening her thoughts. She saw Lev’s lifeless shape just a few yards away. She saw Dr. Angela close her eyes in resignation, Rowan trembling, the recruits quietly weeping. And she saw the Commonwealth soldier raise his gun toward her head.

Not like this.

With a feral roar, Abby heaved upward with everything she had, the zip-tie biting into her flesh until it snapped. In one fluid motion she grabbed the surprised soldier’s rifle barrel and shoved it aside as it discharged, the shot whizzing past her ear. Using the post she was tied to for leverage, Abby yanked the man forward and drove her knee into his groin. He crumpled with a howl.

“Shoot her!” Beard barked, reaching for his own sidearm. But Abby was already moving. She dove for the downed soldier’s dropped rifle. A hail of bullets tore into the dirt where she’d been kneeling a split second before.

Abby rolled and came up firing. Her first burst caught the soldier who’d been holding Rowan, hitting him square in the chest. He fell, and Rowan scrambled away on hands and knees. The next shots she directed at another attacker rushing from her right, dropping him as well. Years of drilling, of battle instinct, took over; the pain in her body was forgotten, adrenaline fueling her aim.

Beard ducked behind a concrete pillar as Abby’s next bullets sparked off it. Dr. Angela and the recruits had thrown themselves flat in the confusion. The only enemy left was Beard himself, now pinned down by Abby’s gunfire. She advanced, teeth gritted, feeling every ounce of righteous wrath pumping in her veins. This man had ordered her people killed, had killed *Lev*. Abby’s vision went red.

She kept firing until the rifle clicked empty. The pillar was chipped and pocked, but Beard still hid behind it. Breathing hard, Abby tossed aside the spent gun and limped toward the center of the courtyard. Smoke burned her eyes. Flames crackled from a structure about to collapse. The night air reeked of blood and ash.

“Come out!” Abby roared into the silence. “Face me!” She scanned for movement. The only sound was the crackle of embers and Dr. Angela’s muffled sobs in the background.

A clatter drew Abby’s attention—Beard’s rifle skidding out from behind the pillar. He emerged right after, arms raised halfway. She saw he had a knife in one hand, glinting orange in the firelight.

His face contorted with rage and despair. “You… you’ll pay for what you did,” he spat. “My brother, my men… all dead because of *you*.”

Abby’s lip curled. “You attacked us, asshole.” She advanced a step, fists clenched. Her leg throbbed where she’d been shot, but she barely registered it.

The leader’s eyes flickered past her, toward Lev’s body. “Your people murdered and enslaved in Santa Barbara. You think we wouldn’t seek justice? You think I wouldn’t hunt down the woman responsible?” His glare bore into Abby. “Yes, I know what you did. One of your victims escaped to tell the tale.”

Abby realized he was talking about the Rattlers—the slavers who had captured her and Lev in Santa Barbara. She had indeed slaughtered many of them during their escape, liberating captives. She felt no remorse for that. Those men were monsters. But apparently one had survived and joined this Commonwealth, spinning a story that painted Abby as the villain.

“We freed their prisoners,” Abby snarled. “Those bastards were slavers. They deserved worse.” She spat a glob of blood at the ground. “If that’s who you’re avenging, then you’re as bad as they were.”

Beard’s expression faltered just a moment, uncertainty in his eyes. Then fury overtook him. With a hoarse yell, he lunged at Abby, swinging the knife.

Abby was ready. She sidestepped his slash, catching his wrist with both hands. He was strong and barrel-chested, but Abby fueled her movements with raw anguish. She slammed his arm against the pillar; bones cracked and the knife clattered free. Beard roared in pain and punched at her with his off-hand, grazing her cheek. Abby barely flinched. She grabbed the front of his vest and drove him backward, slamming him down onto the concrete rubble.

He hit the ground with a pained oof. In a flash, Abby picked up a brick from the shattered pillar. She loomed over the man who had ordered Lev’s death, who had tried to wipe out all the Fireflies in cold blood. Her vision blurred with tears of rage as she raised the brick.

“Wait—!” Beard rasped, throwing a hand up in a feeble warding gesture. His eyes widened at the murderous resolve on Abby’s face. In that moment, he was simply afraid to die.

So had her friends been. So had Lev.

Abby brought the brick down. Once, twice, three times—until the man’s face was unrecognizable and her own arms trembled from the force of her vengeance. When she finally stopped, panting, a dark red mist seemed to cloud the air. Beard lay still, his skull caved in, blood pooling around his head.

Silence fell at last over Catalina Island. Abby staggered to her feet, the brick slipping from her fingers. Immediately her knees buckled as the rush of adrenaline ebbed, pain flooding in. She clutched the bullet graze on her thigh—wet blood coated her palm. Her ribs and head throbbed fiercely.

But none of it compared to the pain in her heart.

“Lev…” she croaked, forcing herself up and limping to where Lev lay. She dropped to her knees beside him. The boy’s eyes were half-open, staring at the starless smoky sky. Abby’s hands shook as she reached out to touch his face. It was still warm. For one stupid, hopeful second she thought maybe he was just unconscious. But his chest was still, no breath, and the wound… The bullet had gone straight through. Too much blood.

“No, no, no,” Abby whispered, gathering Lev’s limp body into her arms. His head lolled against her shoulder as she cradled him. He felt so light, as if all the life that gave him weight had fled. “Lev… please…” She rocked him gently, tears sliding down her grime-streaked cheeks. “I’m here, I’m here. Wake up, kiddo… Please…” Her voice broke.

He did not stir. The kid who had become her family, the one who saved her soul, was gone. Abby pressed her forehead to Lev’s and let out a keening sob. Grief, stark and all-consuming, crashed over her. She had failed him. Just like she had failed Yara. Just like she had failed her father. Everyone she ever tried to protect… gone.

Dr. Angela and the others slowly approached, having freed themselves once it was safe. But they kept a respectful distance, forming a silent, mourning circle around Abby and the boy she held.

Minutes or hours later—Abby couldn’t tell—a subtle noise pricked at the edge of her awareness. Footsteps, approaching cautiously over debris. Abby’s grief sharpened into protectiveness in an instant. She gently laid Lev down and rose, picking up the fallen knife from earlier. Someone was coming—maybe another enemy? Her muscles protested as she staggered upright, but she gripped the blade, ready to fight until she couldn’t breathe.

A lone figure emerged from behind the charred husk of the radio tower. The stranger’s silhouette was slight and carrying a backpack. They froze upon seeing the massacre in the courtyard.

In the flicker of firelight, Abby saw a young woman with auburn hair, her face dirty and wary. Recognition slammed into Abby as the woman stepped forward, green eyes wide at the sight of Abby dripping in blood and standing amid corpses.

Ellie.

Abby’s world tilted. She thought for a moment she was hallucinating from pain and sorrow. Ellie was the last person she expected to see here, now. Those eyes—the last time Abby had seen them, they were filled with vengeful fury on a beach in Santa Barbara, before Ellie had decided to spare her life. Now they stared with shock, confusion… maybe even concern?

Ellie’s gaze darted from Abby’s battered form to Lev’s lifeless body on the ground, and the cluster of traumatized Fireflies nearby. Her lips parted as if to speak, but she hesitated, caught between approach and retreat.

Abby’s grief ignited into sudden rage. In her daze, her mind leapt to a horrific assumption: Ellie had come here, found them—and maybe… had something to do with this? The idea made no logical sense, but Abby wasn’t thinking clearly. Pain and vengeance were all she knew in that moment. With a guttural yell, Abby charged at Ellie, knife raised.

Ellie barely had time to register the movement. Abby tackled her to the ground, knocking Ellie’s backpack aside. The knife arced down, but Ellie managed to twist, the blade skittering off the armored plate of her jacket shoulder instead of flesh. “Abby—wait!” Ellie gasped, raising her forearms to ward off Abby’s frenzied strikes. Abby swung again, a wild slash that nicked Ellie’s cheek.

“YOU—” Abby snarled, voice ragged. She pinned Ellie with her weight. Ellie, smaller but wiry, fought back defensively, grabbing Abby’s wrist to stop the knife plunging toward her throat. “What did you DO?!” Abby’s face was a mask of grief and fury above Ellie.

“I—I didn’t—!” Ellie gritted her teeth, straining against Abby’s strength. Even injured and exhausted, Abby was formidable. Ellie knew Abby could end her right here, but strangely, she felt no desire to hurt Abby. Not anymore. In a scramble, Ellie managed to get a leg free and kicked upward, forcing Abby off balance.

The two women separated, rolling to their feet in unison. They faced each other amidst the carnage, chests heaving. Abby’s knife glinted in one hand; Ellie’s own switchblade had found its way into her palm. An eerie mirror of their final confrontation years ago in that Seattle theater, except now both were battered, hearts heavy with recent wounds.

Abby’s eyes were wild, tears still streaming down her face. “You brought them here, didn’t you?” she growled, voice breaking. “You couldn’t let it go… you came to finish it!”

Ellie shook her head, panting. A thin line of blood trickled from the cut on her cheek. “Abby, no! I swear—I had nothing to do with this!” She flicked a desperate glance around at the bodies. “I-I heard the explosions and came running. I didn’t know… I was coming to find the Fireflies!”

Abby’s grip on the knife wavered. Confusion knitted her brow, cutting through her haze. “Why would you…?” Her eyes darted to Lev’s body, and fresh agony twisted her features. She took a step toward Ellie, knife still raised uncertainly. “My friends are dead. *He’s* dead,” she choked out, voice raw. “Why shouldn’t I blame you?”

Ellie swallowed, holding her ground but not attacking. She could see Abby’s devastation and knew too well the madness grief could drive someone to. Her own rage had made her a monster once; she recognized it now in Abby. “Because it’s not my fault,” she said, trying to keep her voice calm but loud enough to penetrate Abby’s anguish. “That group—whoever they are—I’m not with them. I was looking for this place to—” She faltered. How much did Abby know? Likely nothing. “—to find purpose,” she finished vaguely. “I only got here as it was happening.”

A strained silence stretched. The firelight flickered over Abby’s torn expression. Behind them, Dr. Angela quietly ushered the others out of harm’s way, into the shadows.

Abby’s shoulders heaved. The knife in her hand trembled. She stared at Ellie as if seeing her for the first time—a lone figure who looked almost as broken as Abby felt. Ellie’s hands were open at her sides now, her blade lowered. She wasn’t attacking.

Ellie took a slow breath. “Abby… I’m sorry,” she said softly, and her eyes flicked to Lev’s body. Sincere sorrow tinged her voice. She had barely known the boy, but she remembered his kindness on that theater stage, saving Dina’s life by stopping Abby. And now he lay still. “I’m so sorry.”

Abby’s face crumpled. All the fight drained out of her in an instant. Her knife slipped from her fingers and clattered to the ground. A ragged sob tore from her throat and she sank to her knees. The pain was overwhelming—physical and emotional. She pressed her palms to her face as if trying to hold herself together, but she was shattering.

Ellie stood there, heart pounding, as Abby collapsed into grief. Carefully, she knelt a short distance in front of Abby, making sure to move slowly. She still didn’t fully trust Abby’s volatile state, but some instinct told her the danger had passed.

Abby’s sobs were gut-wrenching. “They’re dead… everyone’s dead,” she gasped between breaths, fingers digging into her scalp. “Lev… I couldn’t save him. I couldn’t—” She broke off, shaking.

Ellie’s chest tightened. Despite everything—despite the history of blood and loss between them—seeing Abby like this stirred a deep empathy in her. Abby had once been her mortal enemy, but right now she was just a person who’d lost someone she loved. Ellie knew too well what that pain felt like.

Without quite realizing she was doing it, Ellie inched closer and placed a hand gently on Abby’s shoulder. Abby flinched at the touch and looked up, eyes red and wet. There was shock in her expression that Ellie was still here, that Ellie wasn’t trying to hurt her.

“I’m sorry,” Ellie repeated, earnest and gentle. “That boy… he meant a lot to you.”

Abby wiped her nose with the back of her hand, nodding mutely. Fresh tears spilled. “He was… he was everything. My family.” She drew a shuddering breath. “I promised to protect him.”

Ellie’s throat burned. She thought of Sam and Henry, of Tess, of Joel—so many promises to keep each other safe, broken by this vicious world. “Sometimes… no matter how hard we try… we can’t,” she said quietly, voice thick with her own old grief.

Abby closed her eyes, tears leaking out. For a long moment, they just stayed like that: Abby on her knees amid ruins, and Ellie kneeling nearby, a hesitant hand on her shoulder as the fires around them guttered low.

At last, Abby’s sobs subsided into uneven sniffles. She opened her eyes and looked at Ellie in bewilderment, as if truly registering her presence now. “Why are you here, Ellie?” Her tone held no anger now, only exhaustion and confusion. “After everything… why would you come find us?”

Ellie withdrew her hand and sat back on her heels, giving Abby a bit of space. She wasn’t sure how to begin. The truth seemed impossible, but maybe it was time it came out. Her gaze drifted to the bloody Firefly pendant hanging from Abby’s neck, then to the corpses around them, then finally to Lev’s still face. She owed him, perhaps, this honesty, for he had a part in stopping the cycle of hate between her and Abby once.

“I heard the Fireflies were regrouping,” Ellie said slowly. “Looking for someone… someone immune.” She hesitated, watching Abby’s face for recognition. Abby frowned, listening intently. “I thought… maybe I could help. That maybe it was finally time to stop running from… from who I am.”

Abby’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Someone immune? You mean… the rumor is real?”

Ellie’s heart pounded. This was it. She reached up and tugged the bandage she kept wrapped around her forearm, pulling it down to reveal the grotesque scar of her bite. In the low light, it was just visible—faintly luminescent fungus-like patterns etched into her skin. The mark of a decades-old infection that never spread.

Abby stared at the scar, not comprehending at first. Then her eyes widened. She knew a bite scar when she saw one. “That’s… impossible,” she breathed.

Ellie managed a shaky half-smile that held no joy. “Not impossible. Not for me. I was bitten when I was fourteen. I should’ve turned, but I didn’t. I never have.”

Abby shook her head slowly, denial and astonishment warring on her face. Ellie couldn’t blame her—if she hadn’t lived it, she wouldn’t believe it either. To prove her point, Ellie slid aside the collar of her shirt and exposed another scar at her shoulder—a much more recent bite, courtesy of a Rattler that attacked her during her trip to Santa Barbara. It too had healed without turning her.

“They bit me here, a couple years ago,” Ellie said softly. “Nothing happened, just like before.”

Abby’s lips parted. Ellie could practically see the pieces falling into place in Abby’s mind—the realization dawning of what this could mean. Abby’s father… the Firefly lab… Joel… Her eyes flicked to Ellie’s face, searching it, as if to confirm this wasn’t some sick prank. “You’re immune,” she whispered, the word laden with awe.

Ellie nodded, her stomach twisting. “I am.”

Abby rocked back as if hit by a wave. She looked around at the devastation, then back at Ellie. “And… and you came here… to what? Sacrifice yourself?”

Ellie lowered her gaze. “If that’s what it takes,” she admitted softly. “I should have done it years ago.” Her voice hardened a little with old guilt. “I was supposed to. The Fireflies had me in that hospital in Salt Lake… they were going to make a cure from me.”

Abby sucked in a sharp breath. Her hands went slack in her lap. “Salt Lake… hospital…” she echoed. Her face paled as truth crashed over her. “My dad… my dad was there.”

Ellie nodded, throat tight. “Jerry Anderson. He was the surgeon. The one who… who was going to operate on me.” She blinked back the sting in her eyes. “He was your father, wasn’t he?”

Abby’s mouth opened, but no sound came out. She looked as though the ground had dropped beneath her. At long last, she gave a tiny nod. “How… how do you know his name?”

A sad smile tugged at Ellie’s lips. “Because Joel told me. I made him tell me everything.” She took a shaky breath. This was the hardest part. “That day, when you found him… when you killed Joel… He was there in that hospital to save me. To save *everyone*. And Joel… Joel stopped it. He stopped the surgery and took me away. He killed your dad to protect me.”

Abby flinched as if struck. A strangled noise escaped her, and she pressed a hand over her mouth. Ellie could see the storm of emotions raging behind her eyes: anger, disbelief, guilt, sadness, all swirling together.

“I-I didn’t know,” Abby stammered finally, voice trembling. “I knew he was killed protecting someone, but… I didn’t know it was you. I didn’t know what you were.” A tear slipped down her cheek. “All this time… Joel took that from the world… I… I took Joel from the world… and none of us knew.”

Ellie felt her own tears welling. It was agonizing to see Abby realize the full weight of what her revenge had cost. “Joel did what he did out of love,” she said. “And you… you did what you did out of love too, I guess. Love for your dad.” She managed to meet Abby’s gaze. “This world… it’s always making us choose between the people we care about and the future everyone might have. Joel chose me. You chose your revenge.” She looked at Lev’s body. “And tonight, you chose him.”

Abby followed Ellie’s eyes to Lev. She inhaled a shaky breath and nodded. “I did.” A silence lingered, the two women united in grief and understanding.

Ellie gingerly rose to her feet, bruises and exhaustion making her ache. She extended a hand toward Abby. “Come on,” she said softly. “We… we should tend to the others. Then we can figure out our next steps.”

Abby glanced up at Ellie’s outstretched hand—the same hand that had once held a knife to her throat in Seattle. Now it was offering help. Abby hesitated only a moment before taking it. Ellie pulled her to her feet. Abby swayed, her injuries catching up to her, and Ellie grabbed her elbow to steady her.

Dr. Angela and Rowan approached tentatively, relief evident that the fight was over. Rowan had a rifle slung over his shoulder—likely taken from one of the fallen attackers. He looked at Abby and Ellie with equal parts confusion and hope, not yet knowing what had passed between them in those moments of revelation.

Abby cleared her throat, wiping her tears with the back of her hand. She straightened, regaining a bit of composure in front of her people. “Is… is anyone else alive?” she asked, her voice rough but authoritative.

Rowan shook his head grimly. “Only us here, and a few who ran into the woods. We’ll try to signal them when it’s safe. The boat… it’s gone. They sank it.”

Abby nodded, jaw clenching at that blow. It meant they were stranded for now. “We’ll think of something,” she said, trying to sound confident. She looked to Dr. Angela. “Are you hurt?”

The older woman shook her head, though her eyes were puffy from crying. “Just shaken.” Her gaze fell to Ellie curiously, noting the way Abby stood close by her side rather than at her throat. “Who…?”

“This is Ellie,” Abby introduced quietly. She glanced at Ellie, a new weight behind her eyes. “She’s… the one we’ve been looking for. The immune girl.”

The realization rippled through the small group. Rowan’s eyes widened and Dr. Angela’s hand flew to her mouth in astonishment. One of the young recruits—a teenage boy who had survived by hiding under a corpse during the fight—murmured, “No way…”

Ellie felt self-conscious under the sudden awed stares. She rubbed her scarred forearm, covering it again with her sleeve. “I’m not much to look at,” she joked weakly. “But yeah. It’s true.”

Abby placed a steadying hand on Ellie’s shoulder, an almost protective gesture that surprised them both. “We should… take stock and treat wounds,” she said. Her tone had shifted to brisk determination, a leader’s voice tempered by sorrow. “Then plan. We can’t stay here long; they might come back with more.”

Dr. Angela nodded and immediately moved toward the infirmary, motioning for Ellie and Abby to follow so she could tend to their injuries. Rowan began gathering whatever weapons and supplies he could salvage from the fallen.

Abby paused and looked down at Lev one more time. Her eyes shone with tears not yet shed. “We’ll take him with us,” Ellie said gently, reading her thoughts. “We’ll give him a proper… a proper goodbye when we can.”

Abby swallowed hard and whispered, “Thank you.” It was unclear whether she meant for that or for something far greater. Perhaps both.

Together, Abby and Ellie carefully lifted Lev’s body, carrying him toward the remnants of the clinic where they could wrap him. In that moment, their past enmity felt distant, swallowed by the enormity of what they had lost and what they had discovered. Their shared goal—once unimaginable—now bound them: they would see that Lev’s death, that all this death, was not in vain. They would seek out the cure, together.

In the shattered remnants of the Firefly camp, under the smoke-streaked sky, an uneasy alliance was born. Two survivors, once enemies, now walked side by side into an uncertain dawn, carrying the weight of the world’s last hope between them.

## Chapter 4: Loss and Remnants

Ellie helped Abby bury Lev at first light. They found a quiet spot on a bluff overlooking the Catalina shoreline, where the gentle rush of waves below could sing him to sleep. The grave was shallow and the soil stony—far from ideal—but Abby refused to leave the island without laying Lev to rest. Ellie silently helped, the two of them digging with a rusted shovel and their bare hands when needed. Each scrape of earth was accompanied by Abby’s soft, trembling breaths and Ellie’s murmured words of comfort.

Dr. Angela and Rowan stood a respectful distance away, keeping watch for any lingering Commonwealth stragglers. The battle was won, but danger still lurked.

When Lev’s small body was finally covered, Abby placed his recurve bow atop the mound, the same bow he’d made so lethal despite his gentle heart. Abby knelt there for a long moment, fingers brushing the bow’s grip one last time. Ellie hovered at her side, head bowed, unsure whether to give Abby privacy or solidarity. In the end, she settled for resting a hand on Abby’s shoulder until Abby slowly rose, eyes red but gratitude shining dimly through her grief.

They burned what remained of the camp’s structures—both to deny the Commonwealth any resources if they returned and to honor those fallen by fire’s cleansing light. With heavy hearts, the survivors gathered what supplies they could: medical gear, ammunition, a few days’ worth of food, and several journals and maps Rowan insisted on saving from the comm shack.

By midday, they were ready to depart the island. The Commonwealth’s assault craft—a weather-beaten motorboat moored in a rocky cove—still bobbed on the tide. Abby and Rowan rigged it for departure, siphoning fuel from a backup generator to top the tank. Ellie stood on the shore with Dr. Angela, gazing out at the sun-glittered waves. She felt hollowed out by the morning’s sorrow and revelations, yet in that emptiness a purpose thrummed. She was here, on the threshold of something Joel had once died to prevent, something that might give meaning to everything.

Abby approached, her rifle slung and pack loaded. “Boat’s ready,” she said quietly. Her voice was hoarse from grief and disuse, but steady. “It’s about thirty miles to the mainland. If the motor holds, we’ll be across before nightfall.”

Ellie nodded. She glanced back once at the smoking remains of the Firefly haven. Among the embers and ash lay the bodies of people Abby had called comrades—and friends. Ellie swallowed the lump in her throat. “You okay?” she asked Abby softly.

Abby looked down at her blood-crusted boots. “No,” she admitted. “But I will be… once we finish this.” She lifted her gaze to meet Ellie’s. In Abby’s eyes, Ellie saw a determination that matched her own. However much pain Abby was in, she’d channel it toward the cure now.

They helped Dr. Angela and Rowan into the boat, then pushed off from the shore. Abby took the wheel, guiding them out of the cove. Ellie sat near the bow, watching Catalina recede—a green gem in an endless blue sea, now marred by smoke. She silently vowed to remember Lev, Yara, and all of Abby’s friends through the life that was to come. *I’ll make it count,* she thought.

The journey across the channel was mercifully calm. Ellie dozed for a short while, lulled by the engine’s rumble and the spray’s hiss. In her dream, Joel sat beside her on the boat, playing the guitar softly as seagulls cried overhead. He didn’t speak, just played that familiar melody that always made her chest ache with love. When she woke, Abby had cut the engine—they were approaching the California coast.

They made landfall in a ruined marina near San Pedro. The harbor was clogged with derelict yachts and fishing vessels, some half-sunk and covered in barnacles. As the boat bumped against a concrete jetty, Rowan jumped ashore to tie it off.

The mainland greeted them with silence. No welcoming party, hostile or friendly, appeared—just the wind sighing through skeletal dock cranes. The four travelers disembarked, tense and alert.

“We should find transportation,” Rowan suggested, keeping his voice low. “The sooner we head east, the better.”

Luck was with them: parked behind a collapsed boathouse, they found a rusting pickup truck that still had a battery and a bit of gas in the tank. After some quick tinkering, Rowan hotwired it successfully. The engine sputtered, then roared to life.

Abby took the driver’s seat, Ellie shotgun. As they pulled away from the marina, Ellie watched Abby’s eyes flick to the rearview mirror, where Catalina’s outline faded on the horizon. Abby’s jaw tightened; Ellie knew she was thinking of the grave they left behind. Ellie reached over and touched Abby’s arm lightly. Abby exhaled and gave a small nod—silent thanks, or maybe just acknowledgment that she was alright to continue.

They drove east through the outskirts of Los Angeles. The city’s skyline was a skeletal ghost in the smoggy distance, and they avoided it, keeping to back roads. Twice they were forced to clear debris blocking their route—once an overturned bus, another time a tangle of abandoned military barricades from some long-ago stand. Each delay made them more anxious that the Commonwealth might return in pursuit.

By nightfall, they reached the desert beyond San Bernardino. The stars emerged in the clear sky as Abby finally pulled off the road near a derelict diner. They dared a small fire inside the diner’s collapsed roof, heating cans of soup for dinner in uneasy quiet.

Later, Ellie found Abby outside, standing apart under the stars much as she had on Catalina’s pier. Ellie approached, and they stood shoulder to shoulder for a moment without speaking. The desert night was chilly.

Abby broke the silence, her voice low. “I’m sorry, Ellie… for attacking you back there. For nearly…” She closed her eyes, shame creasing her brow. “I wasn’t myself.”

Ellie shook her head. “You don’t owe me an apology. I understand. If I had lost…” She trailed off, thinking of Dina and JJ, and how unhinged she’d become after Joel. “Grief makes us do terrible things.”

Abby looked up at the sky, eyes reflecting the moonlight. “I think… I finally understand Joel. What he did. If I had been in his place… holding someone I loved on that table…” Her voice strained. “I wouldn’t have done differently.”

Ellie felt a pang in her heart. This was a full circle she never expected—they both understood Joel now in ways neither wanted to. “He loved me,” Ellie whispered. “And I hated him for it, for a long time. But in the end… I forgave him.”

Abby turned to her, surprised. Ellie hadn’t spoken of Joel’s end yet. Ellie managed a small smile, remembering that porch conversation with Joel, their last peaceful night. “He was ready to make things right. I just wish we’d had more time.”

Abby hesitated, then asked, “What would he think… of this? Of what we’re doing?”

Ellie’s eyes stung. “He wouldn’t want me to do it. But… I think he’d understand why I need to.” She sniffed and straightened. “Anyway. Try to get some rest. We’ve got a long drive tomorrow.”

Abby nodded, swiping at her eyes. Before they went inside, she said softly, “For what it’s worth, I’m glad you found me. That we’re… not alone in this.”

Ellie offered a hand, the ghost of a smile on her lips. Abby clasped it, a brief but genuine shake sealing the sentiment. No more alone.

They continued the journey at dawn. Dr. Angela took over driving for a spell along Interstate 15 through Nevada, giving Abby’s weary body a break. Ellie dozed fitfully in the backseat, lulled by the drone of tires on asphalt.

She dreamed of Dina. In the dream, Dina was laughing as they danced in the kitchen of their farmhouse, sunlight slanting across the floorboards. JJ clapped his tiny hands, toddling between them. Ellie felt a deep ache of longing even within the dream—an awareness that this was something that might never come to pass again. Dina’s laughter faded, and as dream-Ellie reached out for her, Dina turned away, walking into a fog, carrying JJ on her hip. “I’m sorry,” Ellie called after her in the dream, but Dina disappeared, and Ellie was left alone in an empty, silent house.

She awoke with tears on her cheeks. They were somewhere in Utah now, golden plains stretching out on either side. Rowan, still recovering from his injury, gave her a sympathetic look from the front. Ellie wiped her face quickly and stared out the window as they drove on.

Late the next day, the small caravan entered Salt Lake City under a bruised-purple sunset. Time was running in strange loops for Ellie here; it had been more than two years since she last came through, but in her heart it might have been yesterday. St. Mary’s Hospital loomed ahead, its familiar facade half-shrouded in twilight.

Abby parked the truck several blocks from the quarantine zone perimeter to avoid detection. They would go on foot from here.

Crouching behind an overturned billboard, they surveyed the old FEDRA quarantine zone and hospital beyond. It was far from abandoned. Floodlights illuminated sections of the exterior. Armed Commonwealth soldiers patrolled in pairs. Tents and vehicles crowded a former parking lot—a base of operations.

“They’ve taken over the hospital,” Rowan whispered. “Looks like a central hub.”

Ellie’s stomach knotted. “That’s where we need to be,” she said, nodding toward the hospital’s upper floors. “The surgical wing.”

Abby’s face was drawn tight, no doubt remembering that place vividly. “We’ll find a way,” she said.

Under cover of darkness, they circled to the east side of the QZ where the fence had collapsed. Slipping through gaps in the rubble and sneaking past a dozing guard, they found themselves in a familiar courtyard—the one Joel had driven through in a mad dash years ago with Ellie unconscious in his arms. Ellie’s heart pounded at the memory.

Now, it was eerily quiet. The infected had likely been cleared by the Commonwealth. Only distant shouts and the rumble of a generator broke the silence.

The group split for a two-pronged approach as planned. Rowan and Dr. Angela quietly made their way toward a maintenance shed where they hoped to access the hospital’s PA system and sprinklers. Meanwhile, Abby and Ellie crept toward a loading dock on the ground floor. The plan was simple: cause a big enough distraction to draw most of the soldiers out of position, then slip inside to reach the surgical wing.

Abby handed Ellie a Molotov cocktail they’d fashioned en route. “Ready?” she breathed.

Ellie nodded, adrenaline coursing. “Ready.”

At Abby’s signal, a deafening alarm klaxon suddenly blared from the shed—Rowan’s doing. Simultaneously, sprinklers throughout the camp burst on, dousing everything in chaotic jets of water. Soldiers shouted in confusion.

Ellie lit the rag of the Molotov with her lighter and hurled it into the motor pool where several jeeps were parked. It shattered in a whoosh of flame, igniting one vehicle’s gas tank in a fiery blast. The night lit up orange.

“Fire! We’re under attack!” voices yelled. Immediately, soldiers rushed toward the blaze. The carefully laid trap was sprung: within moments, a majority of the Commonwealth troops were scrambling to contain the fire and secure the perimeter against a presumed large enemy.

In the commotion, Abby and Ellie darted up a side stairwell into the hospital’s east wing. Ellie’s heart hammered as they passed a sign: **Surgery and Pediatrics – Floor 6**. She remembered going under anesthesia near that very spot all those years ago.

They encountered their first foe in a corridor outside the pediatric unit—a lone guard guarding a hallway. Abby was on him before he could react, clamping a hand over his mouth and choking him out silently. She eased his unconscious form to the floor and retrieved his keycard.

Ellie led the way through the maze of halls, guided by painful familiarity. At one junction, she froze, recognizing the tiled hallway where Joel had massacred a squad to reach her. Dark stains still marred the walls there. Abby gently touched her arm, snapping her out of it. They pressed on.

Finally, they reached the pediatric surgery wing. A heavy security door blocked the entrance, a red light on the card reader. Abby swiped the keycard. With a beep and a thunk, the lock released.

They slipped inside and barred it behind them. For now, they were safe.

The operating rooms lay beyond a set of swinging doors. As they pushed through, Ellie’s breath caught. The main OR was exactly as she remembered in her nightmares: overhead lights, sterile steel tables. But now, it was repurposed with new equipment—the Commonwealth had set up here clearly anticipating an immune subject. An array of vials and machines awaited.

Abby moved to the OR doors and peeked through a small window back into the hallway. No pursuit yet, but distant bootsteps echoed—some soldiers remained inside, likely circling back after the initial panic.

Dr. Angela’s voice crackled softly over the portable radio on Abby’s belt. “We’re in position. How’s it looking?”

Abby pressed the talk button. “We made it. OR secure for now.”

Ellie’s hands trembled slightly as she approached the operating table. This was it. The culmination of her journey. Of Joel’s worst fear. Of everything.

Abby turned to Ellie. “We’ll set up for surgery,” she said. “Angela and Rowan will join when it’s clear.”

Ellie nodded. She peeled off her jacket, exposing the bite scar on her arm in full view. She climbed up onto the gurney, lying back on the cool vinyl. A chill crept through her, but she steeled herself with thoughts of Joel, of Dina and JJ, of everyone who had already died in this broken world.

Abby busied herself arranging surgical tools with practiced precision for someone untrained. Ellie realized Abby’s hands were shaking. “Abby,” Ellie said gently. “You don’t have to—”

“I’m fine,” Abby cut her off, voice thick. She secured an IV line to Ellie’s arm, hooking it to a bag of anesthesia Dr. Angela had prepared earlier. Abby’s eyes were glassy with unshed tears. “Ellie… are you absolutely sure?”

Ellie mustered a calm smile, though her heart was thudding. “I am. It’s why I’m here.” She reached out and squeezed Abby’s hand, bloody and bruised as it was. “You can do this. I trust you… and I trust her.” She meant Dr. Angela.

Abby closed her eyes briefly and nodded. Footsteps thudded closer outside—the distraction would only last so long. It was time.

“Thank you… for giving me a choice,” Ellie whispered. It was something Joel never did. Abby met her gaze, and Ellie saw the understanding there.

Without another word, Abby depressed the plunger on the IV. Ellie felt a cold sensation spreading up her arm. Her vision blurred at the edges as the sedative took hold.

From far away, she heard a commotion—a shout beyond the door. Abby drew her pistol with one hand while her other stayed wrapped around Ellie’s. “I’ll keep you safe,” she murmured fervently, tears slipping free at last. “Go to sleep, Ellie. We’ll make it quick. I promise.”

Ellie wanted to respond, to say something reassuring, but the world faded to black before she could.

## Chapter 5: Revelation

Abby pressed a fist to her mouth, trying to steady her breathing. She wanted to scream at the soldiers battering the door, to ward them off by sheer will, but all she could do was hold Ellie's limp hand and pray they'd have enough time.

On the other side of the locked OR doors, heavy thuds reverberated as the Commonwealth troops tried to force entry. One door hinge groaned but held—Abby had jammed it with a steel bar moments after Ellie went under.

"Come on, come on," Abby whispered under her breath, heart in her throat. Dr. Angela was due any minute; she and Rowan had to sneak around to avoid the remaining patrols.

A muffled gunshot made Abby flinch. The attempt to break in had escalated. Through the small window, she saw a soldier slump, struck by a bullet from behind. Then Dr. Angela’s face appeared, eyes wide, as Rowan—pale but determined—waved for Abby to open the door.

Abby rushed to unlatch it. Rowan stumbled in, blood seeping through a bandage at his side, and Dr. Angela followed, clutching a sidearm she’d apparently fired. Outside in the hall, two Commonwealth soldiers lay still; Rowan hit one with a pipe, Angela shot the other.

“We have to hurry,” Dr. Angela panted, stripping off her damp jacket to pull on a surgical gown hanging nearby. She had already scrubbed her hands with iodine, the orange stains up to her elbows proof of her readiness. 

Abby and Rowan dragged a heavy supply cabinet against the doorway to bar any more unwanted guests. The alarm klaxon from Rowan’s earlier diversion still droned faintly, but gunfire outside had diminished—either the infected horde was quelled, or drawn off. Regardless, time was not their ally.

Dr. Angela wheeled a tray of instruments to Ellie’s side and quickly assessed her vitals on the monitoring devices. “Pulse is steady,” she noted, though her voice shook. She glanced at Abby. “Are you prepared, Abby?”

Abby swallowed hard and nodded, donning gloves with trembling hands. She positioned herself opposite the doctor. In this moment, she had to set aside everything—the fear, the guilt, the love and regret. She had to be steady for Ellie. 

With a deep breath, Dr. Angela made the first incision. The atmosphere in the OR tensed into a taut wire of concentration and dread.

Abby assisted where she could, suctioning blood to clear the doctor’s view, handing over instruments with sure if shaky hands. Her mind flashed to her father’s hands doing the same years ago. *This is for you, Dad,* she thought, *and for you too, Ellie.* 

Each second felt interminable. Ellie lay eerily still under the surgeon’s knife, oblivious to the quiet tears that slipped from Abby’s eyes and onto her own mask.

Halfway through the procedure, Rowan’s strained voice crackled from a radio by the door—they had patched into the Commonwealth frequency. “Units 5 and 6, report. Intruders located?” 

A cold sweat broke on Abby’s skin. If reinforcements were coming, they’d come now. Rowan limped to the radio console in the corner, and in a passable imitation of the soldier Angela shot, responded hoarsely, “Negative, still searching east wing. Possible infected outbreak, need backup.” 

The lie might buy them minutes, no more.

Suddenly, Ellie’s heart monitor spiked erratically. Dr. Angela’s eyes snapped to it. “Her BP’s dropping—clamp that artery, now!” she barked. Abby grabbed the clamp with slippery fingers, securing a bleeder as instructed. The monitor stabilized for a moment.

Abby’s entire body trembled with tension. She dared a quick glance at Ellie’s face—somehow serene amidst the brutality. “Hang on, kid,” she whispered, voice catching.

For a brief instant, Abby imagined Lev standing beside her, giving a confident nod like he used to before a big moment. She blinked away tears and refocused. *Keep going. For Lev, for her.*

At last, Dr. Angela let out a breath. “I have what I need,” she said softly, lifting a syringe filled with a golden fluid—cerebral spinal sample infused with the mutated cordyceps. *The key to immunity.* 

Abby’s heart leapt with cautious relief. It was halfway done. Now they had to close Ellie up. 

But fate gave no reprieve. From down the corridor echoed heavy bootsteps—many of them. Flashlight beams danced under the OR door. Muffled voices: “They’ve gotta be here—check the surgery wing!”

Rowan left the console and braced against the door with his shoulder as the first pounding came. The supply cabinet shoved there rattled. He grimaced at Abby. “Finish it. I’ll hold them as long as I can.”

Dr. Angela’s composure faltered for the first time. Her gaze flickered from Ellie’s ashen face to the doorway about to be overrun. “Abby, we must—”

“You must finish,” Abby insisted, a fierce, quiet command. “Stitch her up. I’ll hold them.” 

Before Dr. Angela could protest, Abby snatched up her rifle and marched to Rowan’s side. She placed a hand on his uninjured shoulder. “You’ve done enough. Get to cover in the adjacent room, watch over Ellie from there. I’ll draw them off.”

Rowan opened his mouth, perhaps to argue, but something in Abby’s expression silenced him. With a curt nod, he limped into the recovery room next door, pistol drawn.

Abby took a steadying breath. Behind her, through the observation window between OR and recovery, she saw Dr. Angela bending over Ellie, stitching with deft urgency. Almost done.

*Come on, assholes.* Abby slid her rifle’s safety off.

The cabinet blocking the door began to scrape—pushed by force from outside. Abby raised her gun and fired a short burst through the door itself. Splintered wood and sparks flew; shouting erupted outside.

“Drop your weapons and come out!” a voice bellowed. The door banged harder against the cabinet.

Abby glanced over her shoulder one last time. Ellie was sutured now, Dr. Angela applying dressings. Ellie’s face was ghost-pale but peaceful, as if dreaming sweetly. Abby’s throat tightened. *Stay alive, Ellie. Please.* 

She turned back to the door and, summoning every ounce of her strength and fury, she kicked the supply cabinet aside and yanked the double doors open.

Gunfire erupted immediately, bullets whizzing past her as she ducked and rolled behind an overturned gurney in the hallway. “It’s Anderson!” someone yelled—her name known, likely from that survivor who’d escaped Catalina. 

Abby popped up and returned fire, downing one soldier with a precise shot to the chest plate seam. Their training kicked in; two more advanced from flanks. Abby retreated down the hall, drawing them away from the OR.

A familiar voice stopped her cold: “Stand down, Anderson!” 

Emerging from the stairwell was a tall woman in combat armor, a white C emblazoned on her chest beneath captain’s bars. Her face was severe, eyes cold behind tactical glasses. This had to be General Xia.

Abby leveled her rifle at the general. But she hesitated a crucial half-second, an image flashing of her father’s face — the cost of revenge, the cycle. That half-second lost her advantage.

General Xia’s pistol cracked. Abby felt a hot punch in her left shoulder and cried out, dropping her rifle. 

“Hold your fire!” the general ordered her troops. She stepped forward, pistol trained on Abby who knelt bleeding against the wall. Over the general’s shoulder Abby saw four soldiers fanned out, guns on Abby as well. Too many.

Xia approached slowly. “You’ve caused quite enough trouble,” she said, voice low and brimming with restrained anger. “Where’s the immune girl? Tell me, and maybe my mercy extends to a quick death.”

Abby’s hand crept to the sidearm holstered at her hip. Her shoulder throbbed; blood trickled down her arm. She met Xia’s gaze with defiance. “Go to hell.”

Xia’s lip curled. “Fine. We’ll find her ourselves after you’re gone.” She aimed for Abby’s head.

Suddenly, a shot rang out—from behind Xia. The general’s eyes widened, and she collapsed to the floor, a neat hole between her shoulders. Behind her stood Dina, rifle in hand, panting hard, her face flushed with adrenaline and fury.

The Commonwealth soldiers whirled, stunned by the new attacker. Dina fired again, dropping another trooper with a precise headshot—vengeance for Jesse echoing in her roar.

In the split second of chaos, Abby lunged forward despite her pain. She grabbed the stunned nearest soldier’s gun, forcing it upward as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. With a savage twist, she sent the man crashing into another behind him. 

Dina kept firing, advancing down the corridor with ferocious resolve. “For Ellie!” she screamed as her bullets found their marks. The soldiers, caught between Abby’s brute force and Dina’s deadly aim, fell one by one.

In half a minute, it was over. Eerie silence reclaimed the hall but for Dina’s ragged breathing. She ran toward Abby, eyes wild. “Where is she?! Where’s Ellie?”

Abby, clutching her wounded shoulder, motioned weakly to the OR. “In there… with the doctor.”

Not waiting for further explanation, Dina barreled past Abby into the operating room, calling Ellie’s name.

Abby sagged against the wall, dizzy from relief and blood loss. It was done. Dina was here. Ellie was safe from the Commonwealth, at least for now.

Rowan emerged, gawking at the carnage and Dina’s sudden appearance. He hurried to Abby’s side and eased her to sit. “We need to stop that bleeding.”

Abby hardly heard him. Her focus drifted to the open OR doors, through which she could hear Dina’s heartbroken sobs and apologies, and Dr. Angela’s soothing murmurs. A different pain stabbed Abby’s heart hearing Dina grieve over Ellie’s unmoving form.

Rowan tied off Abby’s shoulder wound with a strip of gauze, hissing in sympathy as Abby winced. He then peered into the OR. “Ellie’s alive,” he reported softly. “Pulse weak but there. They gave her something for pain.” He met Abby’s eyes, voice thick. “We did it, Abby. A cure… it’s coming.”

Abby closed her eyes, tears slipping free—tears of sorrow for Lev and all they lost, of gratitude that Ellie’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain, and of aching empathy for the cries of anguish echoing from Dina’s soul in that operating room.

“Go… help them,” Abby rasped to Rowan, gesturing toward the OR where Dina’s grief was devolving into shouting—her anger seeking someone to blame, and Abby knowing full well who that might be.

Rowan nodded and stepped gingerly inside, to do what he could to console or mediate. Abby remained in the corridor amidst the bodies of her enemies, alone with her turmoil. She pressed her good hand to her forehead, sucking in a shaky breath. It was over. Ellie had done it—given the world a fighting chance. 

But in that victory lay heartbreak as well. Abby wasn’t sure she deserved to join Dina’s mourning or share the solace of that room. Not after all she’d taken from Ellie and Dina both in Seattle.

Abby cast a glance at General Xia’s fallen form nearby. The cycle truly ended here—Xia’s warlike ambition snuffed out, the Fireflies’ dream realized at last. 

With effort, Abby pushed herself up and staggered to the OR doorway. Inside, Dina cradled Ellie’s limp hand, sobbing softly, while Dr. Angela quietly cleaned the surgical site. Rowan stood by, head bowed; he had removed his cap in respect.

Summoning her courage, Abby stepped into the room. Dina looked up, eyes ablaze through tears, and before Abby could utter a word, Dina was on her feet, fists clenched. 

Abby braced, knowing Dina’s grief-fueled fury was justified. She wouldn’t fight back. She owed Dina this, and more.

Dina’s punch caught Abby on the jaw, snapping her head to the side. Abby grunted, tasting blood, but remained still. Dina struck her again and again, shouting accusations—why didn’t you stop her, why aren’t *you* dead instead. Each blow was a lance of guilt Abby accepted without defense.

Finally, Dina collapsed against Abby, the fight leaving her in a flood of tears. Abby caught her, holding Dina up even as Dina weakly pounded a final fist against Abby’s chest. “I’m sorry,” Abby choked out, voice breaking. “I’m so sorry.”

Dr. Angela gently approached them. “Ellie’s sacrifice will save countless lives,” she said softly, though tears glittered in her eyes too. “We won’t waste it. That, I promise you both.”

Dina pulled away from Abby, wiping her face with trembling hands. She returned to Ellie’s side, smoothing Ellie’s hair tenderly. “You hear that, babe?” Dina whispered brokenly. “You’re gonna save the world.”

Abby dared to step nearer, drawn by the heartrending tableau of Dina and Ellie one final time. She fumbled in her pocket and brought out Ellie’s switchblade, her trusty old friend. Abby placed it on the table, nudging it toward Dina. “She wanted you to have that,” Abby murmured, recalling Ellie pressing it into her hand earlier, a silent goodbye meant for Dina all along.

Dina’s breath caught. She reached for the knife and clutched it to her chest, a fresh sob shaking her. “Thank you,” she managed, not looking at Abby but clearly grateful to Ellie.

Silence fell, broken only by Dina’s quiet crying and the distant thrum of helicopters circling outside—the remainder of Commonwealth forces, perhaps, retreating now that their leader was dead and their prize lost.

At length, Dr. Angela covered Ellie’s still form with a clean sheet up to her chest. She checked the monitors and IV. “Her heart’s still beating,” she said softly, as if to reassure herself as much as them. “We’ll keep her comfortable to the end.”

Dina bowed her head, tears dripping onto Ellie’s bandaged arm. Abby finally allowed herself the release she’d held back, tears welling and falling freely.

Rowan sniffed and cleared his throat. “The Fireflies will be here soon,” he announced quietly. “I radioed our nearest camp. They’re sending people to secure this place and… and to help.”

He didn’t say *to help make the cure*, but everyone understood. Ellie’s blood, her samples, would be rushed to labs and scientists who had waited decades for this hope.

Dina gently kissed Ellie’s forehead, smoothing her hair one last time. “I love you,” she whispered, voice cracking. “Always.”

Abby drew closer, mustering the courage to stand opposite Dina across Ellie’s body. “She… she loved you so much, Dina,” Abby said, her voice thick with emotion. “In the end, she did this as much for you and JJ as for anything. She wanted… a better world for you both.”

Dina met Abby’s gaze for the first time without hatred. Only infinite sadness and a faint gratitude showed. Slowly, she gave a single nod. “We’ll make sure it counts,” she murmured.

“We will,” Abby vowed quietly. She reached across and laid a hand over Dina’s where it held Ellie’s. Dina stiffened momentarily, old memories of violence flaring, but then she allowed the contact. In shared grief, past enmities had little meaning.

Beyond the hospital walls, dawn was breaking. A pale light filtered through the small OR window, casting the room in gentle gold. Ellie’s face looked peaceful, almost radiant in that light—a hero’s face, Abby thought, though Ellie would never have called herself that.

“We should go up to the roof,” Rowan suggested softly. “Signal the others. And… maybe get some fresh air.”

Dina nodded after a moment. She leaned down and pressed a final kiss to Ellie’s cheek. Abby squeezed Dina’s shoulder in silent support. Together, they stepped away from the table, leaving Ellie in Dr. Angela’s tender care.

Abby paused at the door, looking back. Her vision swam with tears but she etched the image into her memory: Ellie resting in eternal calm, Dina’s switchblade glinting on her chest, a symbol of the fight and resolve that defined her life. Abby forced herself to turn away. With a deep breath, she guided Dina out into the corridor and toward the stairwell leading upward, Rowan trailing behind.

The three emerged onto the hospital rooftop moments later. The new sun was cresting the Wasatch Mountains to the east, flooding the Salt Lake Valley with warm morning light. For a moment they shielded their eyes, adjusting.

On the horizon, they could make out distant shapes of choppers and vehicles withdrawing—the Commonwealth scattering to the winds. They were no threat now; a new force was rising to take their place: hope.

Dina walked to the roof’s edge, wrapping her arms around herself against the morning chill. Abby stood a pace behind, unsure if Dina wanted space. But after a beat, Dina reached back, wordlessly seeking an anchor, and Abby stepped forward to stand alongside her.

In Dina’s free hand she held Ellie’s switchblade tight. Abby rested her own hand on the butt of her father’s pistol at her hip, a keepsake of another sacrifice long ago. Side by side, they watched as below them, figures began streaming into the hospital grounds—Fireflies, responding to Rowan’s call. Some wore old uniforms, some cobbled-together gear, but all moved with purpose and—yes, Abby dared to think it—joy. 

They had done it. After everything, they had done it.

Dina let out a shaky breath. Her cheeks were wet but she wasn’t crying now; she was staring at that bustling activity below. “They’re… smiling,” she said, voice tinged with incredulous sorrow. And indeed some were—doctor types hugging each other as they carried cases of samples out to trucks, guards clasping shoulders. Ellie’s miracle was already breathing life into these people.

Abby found a sad smile of her own. “She did that,” she replied. “Our Ellie.” The word *our* slipped out naturally; Dina did not correct her.

Rowan stepped away to unfurl a Firefly flag he’d brought up, tying it to a radio antenna so the inbound teams would know exactly who held St. Mary’s now. The flag caught the breeze, its symbol of light fluttering proudly against the morning sky.

Abby flexed her bandaged fingers, the dull ache in her shoulder a constant reminder of the cost of this dawn. “It hurts,” she admitted quietly to Dina.

Dina nodded, eyes distant. “I don’t know if it will ever stop. But… maybe it can mean something. Maybe that can make it bearable.”

Abby recalled Ellie’s words to her before going under: *“Make it count.”* She gave a firm nod. “It will. We’ll make sure of it.”

Below, an impromptu cheer rose up as word spread among the Fireflies that the cure was at hand. Dina closed her eyes, tears escaping anew—grief and pride mingled. “My girl saved the world,” she whispered to no one in particular, or perhaps to the spirit of Ellie listening somewhere beyond.

Abby gently put her arm around Dina’s shoulders. This time, Dina let her, even leaning into Abby’s solid warmth. “She did,” Abby agreed softly. “And we’ll spend whatever lives we have left honoring that.”

They stood that way for a while, two women bound by loss and by the love they both had for Ellie.

In the months to come, Abby knew, they would have challenges beyond imagination—spreading the cure, rebuilding society’s trust, forging a future out of devastation. But she also knew they would face it together, and with purpose. Dina would return to Jackson, to JJ, carrying a vaccine that meant he could grow up unafraid. Abby would go wherever she was needed—perhaps continuing Jerry’s work healing people instead of hurting. It felt fitting.

As the sun climbed higher, a single butterfly fluttered across the rooftop, dancing on the breeze between Abby and Dina before soaring up into the blue. Dina watched it vanish against the light. “She’s free,” Dina murmured, voice full of wistful affection.

Abby nodded, placing her hand over Dina’s where it clutched the switchblade. “Free,” she echoed.

And in that new morning, with the world on the precipice of hope, they allowed themselves a moment of peace. 

They had endured the last of us, the worst of nights. Now, because of Ellie, dawn had come—and with it, perhaps, a chance for all of humanity to finally step from the darkness into light.
