# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 4: Loss and Remnants

Ellie helped Abby bury Lev at first light. They found a quiet spot on a bluff overlooking the Catalina shoreline, where the gentle rush of waves below could sing him to sleep. The grave was shallow and the soil stony, far from ideal, but Abby refused to leave the island without laying Lev to rest. Ellie silently helped, the two of them digging with a rusted shovel and their bare hands when needed. Each scrape of earth was accompanied by Abby's soft, trembling breaths and Ellie's murmured words of comfort.

Dr. Angela and Rowan stood a respectful distance away, keeping watch for any lingering Commonwealth stragglers. The battle was won, but danger still lurked.

When Lev's small body was finally covered, Abby placed his recurve bow atop the mound, the same bow he'd made so lethal despite his gentle heart. Abby knelt there for a long moment, fingers brushing the bow's grip one last time. Ellie hovered at her side, head bowed, unsure whether to give Abby privacy or solidarity. In the end, she settled for resting a hand on Abby's shoulder until Abby slowly rose, eyes red but gratitude shining dimly through her grief.

They burned what remained of the camp's structures, both to deny the Commonwealth any resources if they returned and to honor those fallen by fire's cleansing light. With heavy hearts, the survivors gathered what supplies they could: medical gear, ammunition, a few days' worth of food, and several journals and maps Rowan insisted on saving from the comm shack.

By midday, they were ready to depart the island. The Commonwealth's assault craft, a weather-beaten motorboat moored in a rocky cove, still bobbed on the tide. Abby and Rowan rigged it for departure, siphoning fuel from a backup generator to top the tank. Ellie stood on the shore with Dr. Angela, gazing out at the sun-glittered waves. She felt hollowed out by the morning's sorrow and revelations, yet in that emptiness a purpose thrummed. She was here, on the threshold of something Joel had once died to prevent, something that might give meaning to everything.

Abby approached, her rifle slung and pack loaded. "Boat's ready," she said quietly. Her voice was hoarse from grief and disuse, but steady. "It's about thirty miles to the mainland. If the motor holds, we'll be across before nightfall."

Ellie nodded. She glanced back once at the smoking remains of the Firefly haven. Among the embers and ash lay the bodies of people Abby had called comrades, and friends. Ellie swallowed the lump in her throat. "You okay?" she asked Abby softly.

Abby looked down at her blood-crusted boots. "No," she admitted. "But I will be... once we finish this." She lifted her gaze to meet Ellie's. In Abby's eyes, Ellie saw a determination that matched her own. However much pain Abby was in, she'd channel it toward the cure now.

They helped Dr. Angela and Rowan into the boat, then pushed off from the shore. Abby took the wheel, guiding them out of the cove. Ellie sat near the bow, watching Catalina recede, a green gem in an endless blue sea, now marred by smoke. She silently vowed to remember Lev, Yara, and all of Abby's friends through the life that was to come. I'll make it count, she thought.

The journey across the channel was mercifully calm. Ellie dozed for a short while, lulled by the engine's rumble and the spray's hiss. In her dream, Joel sat beside her on the boat, playing the guitar softly as seagulls cried overhead. He didn't speak, just played that familiar melody that always made her chest ache with love. When she woke, Abby had cut the engine, they were approaching the California coast.

They made landfall in a ruined marina near San Pedro. The harbor was clogged with derelict yachts and fishing vessels, some half-sunk and covered in barnacles. As the boat bumped against a concrete jetty, Rowan jumped ashore to tie it off.

The mainland greeted them with silence. No welcoming party, hostile or friendly, appeared, just the wind sighing through skeletal dock cranes. The four travelers disembarked, tense and alert.

"We should find transportation," Rowan suggested, keeping his voice low. "The sooner we head east, the better."

Luck was with them: parked behind a collapsed boathouse, they found a rusting pickup truck that still had a battery and a bit of gas in the tank. After some quick tinkering, Rowan hotwired it successfully. The engine sputtered, then roared to life.

Abby took the driver's seat, Ellie shotgun. As they pulled away from the marina, Ellie watched Abby's eyes flick to the rearview mirror, where Catalina's outline faded on the horizon. Abby's jaw tightened; Ellie knew she was thinking of the grave they left behind. Ellie reached over and touched Abby's arm lightly. Abby exhaled and gave a small nod, silent thanks, or maybe just acknowledgment that she was alright to continue.

They drove east through the outskirts of Los Angeles. The city's skyline was a skeletal ghost in the smoggy distance, and they avoided it, keeping to back roads. Twice they were forced to clear debris blocking their route, once an overturned bus, another time a tangle of abandoned military barricades from some long-ago stand. Each delay made them more anxious that the Commonwealth might return in pursuit.

By nightfall, they reached the desert beyond San Bernardino. The stars emerged in the clear sky as Abby finally pulled off the road near a derelict diner. They dared a small fire inside the diner's collapsed roof, heating cans of soup for dinner in uneasy quiet.

Later, Ellie found Abby outside, standing apart under the stars much as she had on Catalina's pier. Ellie approached, and they stood shoulder to shoulder for a moment without speaking. The desert night was chilly.

Abby broke the silence, her voice low. "I'm sorry, Ellie... for attacking you back there. For nearly…" She closed her eyes, shame creasing her brow. "I wasn't myself."

Ellie shook her head. "You don't owe me an apology. I understand. If I had lost…" She trailed off, thinking of Dina and JJ, and how unhinged she'd become after Joel. "Grief makes us do terrible things."

Abby looked up at the sky, eyes reflecting the moonlight. "I think... I finally understand Joel. What he did. If I had been in his place... holding someone I loved on that table…" Her voice strained. "I wouldn't have done differently."

Ellie felt a pang in her heart. This was a full circle she never expected, they both understood Joel now in ways neither wanted to. "He loved me," Ellie whispered. "And I hated him for it, for a long time. But in the end... I forgave him."

Abby turned to her, surprised. Ellie hadn't spoken of Joel's end yet. Ellie managed a small smile, remembering that porch conversation with Joel, their last peaceful night. "He was ready to make things right. I just wish we'd had more time."

Abby hesitated, then asked, "What would he think... of this? Of what we're doing?"

Ellie's eyes stung. "He wouldn't want me to do it. But... I think he'd understand why I need to." She sniffed and straightened. "Anyway. Try to get some rest. We've got a long drive tomorrow."

Abby nodded, swiping at her eyes. Before they went inside, she said softly, "For what it's worth, I'm glad you found me. That we're... not alone in this."

Ellie offered a hand, the ghost of a smile on her lips. Abby clasped it, a brief but genuine shake sealing the sentiment. No more alone.

They continued the journey at dawn. Dr. Angela took over driving for a spell along Interstate 15 through Nevada, giving Abby's weary body a break. Ellie dozed fitfully in the backseat, lulled by the drone of tires on asphalt.

She dreamed of Dina. In the dream, Dina was laughing as they danced in the kitchen of their farmhouse, sunlight slanting across the floorboards. JJ clapped his tiny hands, toddling between them. Ellie felt a deep ache of longing even within the dream, an awareness that this was something that might never come to pass again. Dina's laughter faded, and as dream-Ellie reached out for her, Dina turned away, walking into a fog, carrying JJ on her hip. "I'm sorry," Ellie called after her in the dream, but Dina disappeared, and Ellie was left alone in an empty, silent house.

She awoke with tears on her cheeks. They were somewhere in Utah now, golden plains stretching out on either side. Rowan, still recovering from his injury, gave her a sympathetic look from the front. Ellie wiped her face quickly and stared out the window as they drove on.

Late the next day, the small caravan entered Salt Lake City under a bruised-purple sunset. Time was running in strange loops for Ellie here; it had been more than two years since she last came through, but in her heart it might have been yesterday. St. Mary's Hospital loomed ahead, its familiar facade half-shrouded in twilight.

Abby parked the truck several blocks from the quarantine zone perimeter to avoid detection. They would go on foot from here.

Crouching behind an overturned billboard, they surveyed the old FEDRA quarantine zone and hospital beyond. It was far from abandoned. Floodlights illuminated sections of the exterior. Armed Commonwealth soldiers patrolled in pairs. Tents and vehicles crowded a former parking lot, a base of operations.

"They've taken over the hospital," Rowan whispered. "Looks like a central hub."

Ellie's stomach knotted. "That's where we need to be," she said, nodding toward the hospital's upper floors. "The surgical wing."

Abby's face was drawn tight, no doubt remembering that place vividly. "We'll find a way," she said.

Under cover of darkness, they circled to the east side of the QZ where the fence had collapsed. Slipping through gaps in the rubble and sneaking past a dozing guard, they found themselves in a familiar courtyard, the one Joel had driven through in a mad dash years ago with Ellie unconscious in his arms. Ellie's heart pounded at the memory.

Now, it was eerily quiet. The infected had likely been cleared by the Commonwealth. Only distant shouts and the rumble of a generator broke the silence.

The group split for a two-pronged approach as planned. Rowan and Dr. Angela quietly made their way toward a maintenance shed where they hoped to access the hospital's PA system and sprinklers. Meanwhile, Abby and Ellie crept toward a loading dock on the ground floor. The plan was simple: cause a big enough distraction to draw most of the soldiers out of position, then slip inside to reach the surgical wing.

Abby handed Ellie a Molotov cocktail they'd fashioned en route. "Ready?" she breathed.

Ellie nodded, adrenaline coursing. "Ready."

At Abby's signal, a deafening alarm klaxon suddenly blared from the shed, Rowan's doing. Simultaneously, sprinklers throughout the camp burst on, dousing everything in chaotic jets of water. Soldiers shouted in confusion.

Ellie lit the rag of the Molotov with her lighter and hurled it into the motor pool where several jeeps were parked. It shattered in a whoosh of flame, igniting one vehicle's gas tank in a fiery blast. The night lit up orange.

"Fire! We're under attack!" voices yelled. Immediately, soldiers rushed toward the blaze. The carefully laid trap was sprung: within moments, a majority of the Commonwealth troops were scrambling to contain the fire and secure the perimeter against a presumed large enemy.

In the commotion, Abby and Ellie darted up a side stairwell into the hospital's east wing. Ellie's heart hammered as they passed a sign: Surgery and Pediatrics – Floor 6. She remembered going under anesthesia near that very spot all those years ago.

They encountered their first foe in a corridor outside the pediatric unit, a lone guard guarding a hallway. Abby was on him before he could react, clamping a hand over his mouth and choking him out silently. She eased his unconscious form to the floor and retrieved his keycard.

Ellie led the way through the maze of halls, guided by painful familiarity. At one junction, she froze, recognizing the tiled hallway where Joel had massacred a squad to reach her. Dark stains still marred the walls there. Abby gently touched her arm, snapping her out of it. They pressed on.

Finally, they reached the pediatric surgery wing. A heavy security door blocked the entrance, a red light on the card reader. Abby swiped the keycard. With a beep and a thunk, the lock released.

They slipped inside and barred it behind them. For now, they were safe.

The operating rooms lay beyond a set of swinging doors. As they pushed through, Ellie's breath caught. The main OR was exactly as she remembered in her nightmares: overhead lights, sterile steel tables. But now, it was repurposed with new equipment, the Commonwealth had set up here clearly anticipating an immune subject. An array of vials and machines awaited.

Abby moved to the OR doors and peeked through a small window back into the hallway. No pursuit yet, but distant bootsteps echoed, some soldiers remained inside, likely circling back after the initial panic.

Dr. Angela's voice crackled softly over the portable radio on Abby's belt. "We're in position. How's it looking?"

Abby pressed the talk button. "We made it. OR secure for now."

Ellie's hands trembled slightly as she approached the operating table. This was it. The culmination of her journey. Of Joel's worst fear. Of everything.

Abby turned to Ellie. "We'll set up for surgery," she said. "Angela and Rowan will join when it's clear."

Ellie nodded. She peeled off her jacket, exposing the bite scar on her arm in full view. She climbed up onto the gurney, lying back on the cool vinyl. A chill crept through her, but she steeled herself with thoughts of Joel, of Dina and JJ, of everyone who had already died in this broken world.

Abby busied herself arranging surgical tools with practiced precision for someone untrained. Ellie realized Abby's hands were shaking. "Abby," Ellie said gently. "You don't have to, "

"I'm fine," Abby cut her off, voice thick. She secured an IV line to Ellie's arm, hooking it to a bag of anesthesia Dr. Angela had prepared earlier. Abby's eyes were glassy with unshed tears. "Ellie... are you absolutely sure?"

Ellie mustered a calm smile, though her heart was thudding. "I am. It's why I'm here." She reached out and squeezed Abby's hand, bloody and bruised as it was. "You can do this. I trust you... and I trust her." She meant Dr. Angela.

Abby closed her eyes briefly and nodded. Footsteps thudded closer outside, the distraction would only last so long. It was time.

"Thank you... for giving me a choice," Ellie whispered. It was something Joel never did. Abby met her gaze, and Ellie saw the understanding there.

Without another word, Abby depressed the plunger on the IV. Ellie felt a cold sensation spreading up her arm. Her vision blurred at the edges as the sedative took hold.

From far away, she heard a commotion, a shout beyond the door. Abby drew her pistol with one hand while her other stayed wrapped around Ellie's. "I'll keep you safe," she murmured fervently, tears slipping free at last. "Go to sleep, Ellie. We'll make it quick. I promise."

Ellie wanted to respond, to say something reassuring, but the world faded to black before she could.
