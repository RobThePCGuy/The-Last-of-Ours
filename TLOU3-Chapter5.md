# The Last of Us Part III

## Chapter 5: Revelation

Abby pressed a fist to her mouth, trying to steady her breathing. She wanted to scream at the soldiers battering the door, to ward them off by sheer will, but all she could do was hold Ellie's limp hand and pray they'd have enough time.

On the other side of the locked OR doors, heavy thuds reverberated as the Commonwealth troops tried to force entry. One door hinge groaned but held, Abby had jammed it with a steel bar moments after Ellie went under.

"Come on, come on," Abby whispered under her breath, heart in her throat. Dr. Angela was due any minute; she and Rowan had to sneak around to avoid the remaining patrols.

A muffled gunshot made Abby flinch. The attempt to break in had escalated. Through the small window, she saw a soldier slump, struck by a bullet from behind. Then Dr. Angela's face appeared, eyes wide, as Rowan, pale but determined, waved for Abby to open the door.

Abby rushed to unlatch it. Rowan stumbled in, blood seeping through a bandage at his side, and Dr. Angela followed, clutching a sidearm she'd apparently fired. Outside in the hall, two Commonwealth soldiers lay still; Rowan hit one with a pipe, Angela shot the other.

"We have to hurry," Dr. Angela panted, stripping off her damp jacket to pull on a surgical gown hanging nearby. She had already scrubbed her hands with iodine, the orange stains up to her elbows proof of her readiness. 

Abby and Rowan dragged a heavy supply cabinet against the doorway to bar any more unwanted guests. The alarm klaxon from Rowan's earlier diversion still droned faintly, but gunfire outside had diminished, either the infected horde was quelled, or drawn off. Regardless, time was not their ally.

Dr. Angela wheeled a tray of instruments to Ellie's side and quickly assessed her vitals on the monitoring devices. "Pulse is steady," she noted, though her voice shook. She glanced at Abby. "Are you prepared, Abby?"

Abby swallowed hard and nodded, donning gloves with trembling hands. She positioned herself opposite the doctor. In this moment, she had to set aside everything, the fear, the guilt, the love and regret. She had to be steady for Ellie. 

With a deep breath, Dr. Angela made the first incision. The atmosphere in the OR tensed into a taut wire of concentration and dread.

Abby assisted where she could, suctioning blood to clear the doctor's view, handing over instruments with sure if shaky hands. Her mind flashed to her father's hands doing the same years ago. This is for you, Dad, she thought, and for you too, Ellie. 

Each second felt interminable. Ellie lay eerily still under the surgeon's knife, oblivious to the quiet tears that slipped from Abby's eyes and onto her own mask.

Halfway through the procedure, Rowan's strained voice crackled from a radio by the door, they had patched into the Commonwealth frequency. "Units 5 and 6, report. Intruders located?" 

A cold sweat broke on Abby's skin. If reinforcements were coming, they'd come now. Rowan limped to the radio console in the corner, and in a passable imitation of the soldier Angela shot, responded hoarsely, "Negative, still searching east wing. Possible infected outbreak, need backup." 

The lie might buy them minutes, no more.

Suddenly, Ellie's heart monitor spiked erratically. Dr. Angela's eyes snapped to it. "Her BP's dropping, clamp that artery, now!" she barked. Abby grabbed the clamp with slippery fingers, securing a bleeder as instructed. The monitor stabilized for a moment.

Abby's entire body trembled with tension. She dared a quick glance at Ellie's face, somehow serene amidst the brutality. "Hang on, kid," she whispered, voice catching.

For a brief instant, Abby imagined Lev standing beside her, giving a confident nod like he used to before a big moment. She blinked away tears and refocused. Keep going. For Lev, for her.

At last, Dr. Angela let out a breath. "I have what I need," she said softly, lifting a syringe filled with a golden fluid, cerebral spinal sample infused with the mutated cordyceps. The key to immunity. 

Abby's heart leapt with cautious relief. It was halfway done. Now they had to close Ellie up. 

But fate gave no reprieve. From down the corridor echoed heavy bootsteps, many of them. Flashlight beams danced under the OR door. Muffled voices: "They've gotta be here, check the surgery wing!"

Rowan left the console and braced against the door with his shoulder as the first pounding came. The supply cabinet shoved there rattled. He grimaced at Abby. "Finish it. I'll hold them as long as I can."

Dr. Angela's composure faltered for the first time. Her gaze flickered from Ellie's ashen face to the doorway about to be overrun. "Abby, we must, "

"You must finish," Abby insisted, a fierce, quiet command. "Stitch her up. I'll hold them." 

Before Dr. Angela could protest, Abby snatched up her rifle and marched to Rowan's side. She placed a hand on his uninjured shoulder. "You've done enough. Get to cover in the adjacent room, watch over Ellie from there. I'll draw them off."

Rowan opened his mouth, perhaps to argue, but something in Abby's expression silenced him. With a curt nod, he limped into the recovery room next door, pistol drawn.

Abby took a steadying breath. Behind her, through the observation window between OR and recovery, she saw Dr. Angela bending over Ellie, stitching with deft urgency. Almost done.

Come on, assholes. Abby slid her rifle's safety off.

The cabinet blocking the door began to scrape, pushed by force from outside. Abby raised her gun and fired a short burst through the door itself. Splintered wood and sparks flew; shouting erupted outside.

"Drop your weapons and come out!" a voice bellowed. The door banged harder against the cabinet.

Abby glanced over her shoulder one last time. Ellie was sutured now, Dr. Angela applying dressings. Ellie's face was ghost-pale but peaceful, as if dreaming sweetly. Abby's throat tightened. Stay alive, Ellie. Please. 

She turned back to the door and, summoning every ounce of her strength and fury, she kicked the supply cabinet aside and yanked the double doors open.

Gunfire erupted immediately, bullets whizzing past her as she ducked and rolled behind an overturned gurney in the hallway. "It's Anderson!" someone yelled, her name known, likely from that survivor who'd escaped Catalina. 

Abby popped up and returned fire, downing one soldier with a precise shot to the chest plate seam. Their training kicked in; two more advanced from flanks. Abby retreated down the hall, drawing them away from the OR.

A familiar voice stopped her cold: "Stand down, Anderson!" 

Emerging from the stairwell was a tall woman in combat armor, a white C emblazoned on her chest beneath captain's bars. Her face was severe, eyes cold behind tactical glasses. This had to be General Xia.

Abby leveled her rifle at the general. But she hesitated a crucial half-second, an image flashing of her father's face ,  the cost of revenge, the cycle. That half-second lost her advantage.

General Xia's pistol cracked. Abby felt a hot punch in her left shoulder and cried out, dropping her rifle. 

"Hold your fire!" the general ordered her troops. She stepped forward, pistol trained on Abby who knelt bleeding against the wall. Over the general's shoulder Abby saw four soldiers fanned out, guns on Abby as well. Too many.

Xia approached slowly. "You've caused quite enough trouble," she said, voice low and brimming with restrained anger. "Where's the immune girl? Tell me, and maybe my mercy extends to a quick death."

Abby's hand crept to the sidearm holstered at her hip. Her shoulder throbbed; blood trickled down her arm. She met Xia's gaze with defiance. "Go to hell."

Xia's lip curled. "Fine. We'll find her ourselves after you're gone." She aimed for Abby's head.

Suddenly, a shot rang out, from behind Xia. The general's eyes widened, and she collapsed to the floor, a neat hole between her shoulders. Behind her stood Dina, rifle in hand, panting hard, her face flushed with adrenaline and fury.

The Commonwealth soldiers whirled, stunned by the new attacker. Dina fired again, dropping another trooper with a precise headshot, vengeance for Jesse echoing in her roar.

In the split second of chaos, Abby lunged forward despite her pain. She grabbed the stunned nearest soldier's gun, forcing it upward as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. With a savage twist, she sent the man crashing into another behind him. 

Dina kept firing, advancing down the corridor with ferocious resolve. "For Ellie!" she screamed as her bullets found their marks. The soldiers, caught between Abby's brute force and Dina's deadly aim, fell one by one.

In half a minute, it was over. Eerie silence reclaimed the hall but for Dina's ragged breathing. She ran toward Abby, eyes wild. "Where is she?! Where's Ellie?"

Abby, clutching her wounded shoulder, motioned weakly to the OR. "In there... with the doctor."

Not waiting for further explanation, Dina barreled past Abby into the operating room, calling Ellie's name.

Abby sagged against the wall, dizzy from relief and blood loss. It was done. Dina was here. Ellie was safe from the Commonwealth, at least for now.

Rowan emerged, gawking at the carnage and Dina's sudden appearance. He hurried to Abby's side and eased her to sit. "We need to stop that bleeding."

Abby hardly heard him. Her focus drifted to the open OR doors, through which she could hear Dina's heartbroken sobs and apologies, and Dr. Angela's soothing murmurs. A different pain stabbed Abby's heart hearing Dina grieve over Ellie's unmoving form.

Rowan tied off Abby's shoulder wound with a strip of gauze, hissing in sympathy as Abby winced. He then peered into the OR. "Ellie's alive," he reported softly. "Pulse weak but there. They gave her something for pain." He met Abby's eyes, voice thick. "We did it, Abby. A cure... it's coming."

Abby closed her eyes, tears slipping free, tears of sorrow for Lev and all they lost, of gratitude that Ellie's sacrifice wasn't in vain, and of aching empathy for the cries of anguish echoing from Dina's soul in that operating room.

"Go... help them," Abby rasped to Rowan, gesturing toward the OR where Dina's grief was devolving into shouting, her anger seeking someone to blame, and Abby knowing full well who that might be.

Rowan nodded and stepped gingerly inside, to do what he could to console or mediate. Abby remained in the corridor amidst the bodies of her enemies, alone with her turmoil. She pressed her good hand to her forehead, sucking in a shaky breath. It was over. Ellie had done it, given the world a fighting chance. 

But in that victory lay heartbreak as well. Abby wasn't sure she deserved to join Dina's mourning or share the solace of that room. Not after all she'd taken from Ellie and Dina both in Seattle.

Abby cast a glance at General Xia's fallen form nearby. The cycle truly ended here, Xia's warlike ambition snuffed out, the Fireflies' dream realized at last. 

With effort, Abby pushed herself up and staggered to the OR doorway. Inside, Dina cradled Ellie's limp hand, sobbing softly, while Dr. Angela quietly cleaned the surgical site. Rowan stood by, head bowed; he had removed his cap in respect.

Summoning her courage, Abby stepped into the room. Dina looked up, eyes ablaze through tears, and before Abby could utter a word, Dina was on her feet, fists clenched. 

Abby braced, knowing Dina's grief-fueled fury was justified. She wouldn't fight back. She owed Dina this, and more.

Dina's punch caught Abby on the jaw, snapping her head to the side. Abby grunted, tasting blood, but remained still. Dina struck her again and again, shouting accusations, why didn't you stop her, why aren't you dead instead. Each blow was a lance of guilt Abby accepted without defense.

Finally, Dina collapsed against Abby, the fight leaving her in a flood of tears. Abby caught her, holding Dina up even as Dina weakly pounded a final fist against Abby's chest. "I'm sorry," Abby choked out, voice breaking. "I'm so sorry."

Dr. Angela gently approached them. "Ellie's sacrifice will save countless lives," she said softly, though tears glittered in her eyes too. "We won't waste it. That, I promise you both."

Dina pulled away from Abby, wiping her face with trembling hands. She returned to Ellie's side, smoothing Ellie's hair tenderly. "You hear that, babe?" Dina whispered brokenly. "You're gonna save the world."

Abby dared to step nearer, drawn by the heartrending tableau of Dina and Ellie one final time. She fumbled in her pocket and brought out Ellie's switchblade, her trusty old friend. Abby placed it on the table, nudging it toward Dina. "She wanted you to have that," Abby murmured, recalling Ellie pressing it into her hand earlier, a silent goodbye meant for Dina all along.

Dina's breath caught. She reached for the knife and clutched it to her chest, a fresh sob shaking her. "Thank you," she managed, not looking at Abby but clearly grateful to Ellie.

Silence fell, broken only by Dina's quiet crying and the distant thrum of helicopters circling outside, the remainder of Commonwealth forces, perhaps, retreating now that their leader was dead and their prize lost.

At length, Dr. Angela covered Ellie's still form with a clean sheet up to her chest. She checked the monitors and IV. "Her heart's still beating," she said softly, as if to reassure herself as much as them. "We'll keep her comfortable to the end."

Dina bowed her head, tears dripping onto Ellie's bandaged arm. Abby finally allowed herself the release she'd held back, tears welling and falling freely.

Rowan sniffed and cleared his throat. "The Fireflies will be here soon," he announced quietly. "I radioed our nearest camp. They're sending people to secure this place and... and to help."

He didn't say to help make the cure, but everyone understood. Ellie's blood, her samples, would be rushed to labs and scientists who had waited decades for this hope.

Dina gently kissed Ellie's forehead, smoothing her hair one last time. "I love you," she whispered, voice cracking. "Always."

Abby drew closer, mustering the courage to stand opposite Dina across Ellie's body. "She... she loved you so much, Dina," Abby said, her voice thick with emotion. "In the end, she did this as much for you and JJ as for anything. She wanted... a better world for you both."

Dina met Abby's gaze for the first time without hatred. Only infinite sadness and a faint gratitude showed. Slowly, she gave a single nod. "We'll make sure it counts," she murmured.

"We will," Abby vowed quietly. She reached across and laid a hand over Dina's where it held Ellie's. Dina stiffened momentarily, old memories of violence flaring, but then she allowed the contact. In shared grief, past enmities had little meaning.

Beyond the hospital walls, dawn was breaking. A pale light filtered through the small OR window, casting the room in gentle gold. Ellie's face looked peaceful, almost radiant in that light, a hero's face, Abby thought, though Ellie would never have called herself that.

"We should go up to the roof," Rowan suggested softly. "Signal the others. And... maybe get some fresh air."

Dina nodded after a moment. She leaned down and pressed a final kiss to Ellie's cheek. Abby squeezed Dina's shoulder in silent support. Together, they stepped away from the table, leaving Ellie in Dr. Angela's tender care.

Abby paused at the door, looking back. Her vision swam with tears but she etched the image into her memory: Ellie resting in eternal calm, Dina's switchblade glinting on her chest, a symbol of the fight and resolve that defined her life. Abby forced herself to turn away. With a deep breath, she guided Dina out into the corridor and toward the stairwell leading upward, Rowan trailing behind.

The three emerged onto the hospital rooftop moments later. The new sun was cresting the Wasatch Mountains to the east, flooding the Salt Lake Valley with warm morning light. For a moment they shielded their eyes, adjusting.

On the horizon, they could make out distant shapes of choppers and vehicles withdrawing, the Commonwealth scattering to the winds. They were no threat now; a new force was rising to take their place: hope.

Dina walked to the roof's edge, wrapping her arms around herself against the morning chill. Abby stood a pace behind, unsure if Dina wanted space. But after a beat, Dina reached back, wordlessly seeking an anchor, and Abby stepped forward to stand alongside her.

In Dina's free hand she held Ellie's switchblade tight. Abby rested her own hand on the butt of her father's pistol at her hip, a keepsake of another sacrifice long ago. Side by side, they watched as below them, figures began streaming into the hospital grounds, Fireflies, responding to Rowan's call. Some wore old uniforms, some cobbled-together gear, but all moved with purpose and, yes, Abby dared to think it, joy. 

They had done it. After everything, they had done it.

Dina let out a shaky breath. Her cheeks were wet but she wasn't crying now; she was staring at that bustling activity below. "They're... smiling," she said, voice tinged with incredulous sorrow. And indeed some were, doctor types hugging each other as they carried cases of samples out to trucks, guards clasping shoulders. Ellie's miracle was already breathing life into these people.

Abby found a sad smile of her own. "She did that," she replied. "Our Ellie." The word our slipped out naturally; Dina did not correct her.

Rowan stepped away to unfurl a Firefly flag he'd brought up, tying it to a radio antenna so the inbound teams would know exactly who held St. Mary's now. The flag caught the breeze, its symbol of light fluttering proudly against the morning sky.

Abby flexed her bandaged fingers, the dull ache in her shoulder a constant reminder of the cost of this dawn. "It hurts," she admitted quietly to Dina.

Dina nodded, eyes distant. "I don't know if it will ever stop. But... maybe it can mean something. Maybe that can make it bearable."

Abby recalled Ellie's words to her before going under: "Make it count." She gave a firm nod. "It will. We'll make sure of it."

Below, an impromptu cheer rose up as word spread among the Fireflies that the cure was at hand. Dina closed her eyes, tears escaping anew, grief and pride mingled. "My girl saved the world," she whispered to no one in particular, or perhaps to the spirit of Ellie listening somewhere beyond.

Abby gently put her arm around Dina's shoulders. This time, Dina let her, even leaning into Abby's solid warmth. "She did," Abby agreed softly. "And we'll spend whatever lives we have left honoring that."

They stood that way for a while, two women bound by loss and by the love they both had for Ellie.

In the months to come, Abby knew, they would have challenges beyond imagination, spreading the cure, rebuilding society's trust, forging a future out of devastation. But she also knew they would face it together, and with purpose. Dina would return to Jackson, to JJ, carrying a vaccine that meant he could grow up unafraid. Abby would go wherever she was needed, perhaps continuing Jerry's work healing people instead of hurting. It felt fitting.

As the sun climbed higher, a single butterfly fluttered across the rooftop, dancing on the breeze between Abby and Dina before soaring up into the blue. Dina watched it vanish against the light. "She's free," Dina murmured, voice full of wistful affection.

Abby nodded, placing her hand over Dina's where it clutched the switchblade. "Free," she echoed.

And in that new morning, with the world on the precipice of hope, they allowed themselves a moment of peace. 

They had endured the last of us, the worst of nights. Now, because of Ellie, dawn had come, and with it, perhaps, a chance for all of humanity to finally step from the darkness into light.

## The END
